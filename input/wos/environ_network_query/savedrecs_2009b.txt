TI Economic and environmental impacts of transport cost changes on timber
   and forest product markets in Norway
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH

AB Forestry and forest industries are transport-intensive sectors. In Norway, the forest sector (forestry and forest industries) represents less than 1% of gross domestic product, but 14% of the total road transport work. Road transport represents 19% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Norway. This article is an analysis of the economic and GHG emission impacts of the following three transport policy scenarios targeting the forest sector in Norway: (1) increased fuel prices, (2) increased allowable total weight for log trucks, and (3) accelerated infrastructure development. Three different models were combined in the analyses: a national full equilibrium model, a national transport logistics model and a regionalized partial equilibrium forest sector model. The results showed that increased maximum total weight had a greater economic impact on transport costs for roundwood than for forest industry products. Elimination of bottlenecks, such as bridges with limited allowable weight, is needed if the full potential of increased total weight is to be utilized. General infrastructure measures in the main road network had greater economic impacts on forest industries than on forestry. The short-run regional effects of changes in transport costs on production and trade-flows were, however limited, mostly in the range of 1-2%. Increased total weight brought increased emissions of GHGs, owing to transfer from rail to road, whereas accelerated infrastructure investment and increased fuel prices yielded reduced emissions, although the effects were relatively small, in the range of 0.5-1%.

AB Supply chain is viewed as a large-scale system that consists of production and inventory units, organized in a serial structure. Uncertainty is the main attribute in managing the supply chains. Managing a supply chain (SC) is very difficult. since various sources of uncertainty and complex interrelationships among various entities exist in the SC. Uncertainty may result from customer's demand variability or unreliability in external suppliers. In this paper we develop an inventory model for an assembly supply chain network (each unit has at most one immediate successor, but any number of immediate predecessors) which fuzzy demand for single product in one hand and fuzzy reliability of external suppliers in other hand affect on determination of inventory policy in SCM. External supplier's reliability has determined using a fuzzy expert system. Also the performance of supply chain is assessed by two criteria including total cost and fill rate. To solve this bi-criteria model, hybridization of multi-objective particle swarm optimization and simulation optimization is considered. Results indicate the efficiency of proposed approach in performance measurement. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB HIV/AIDS has been found to be a challenging disease to humanity, its challenge spin-offs falling especially on to the caregivers of those infected and affected by the virus. This paper aims to discuss the challenges influencing the state of caregiving in the Kanye community home-based care (CHBC) programme in Botswana. The study was qualitative in design and explorative in nature, involving 82 primary caregivers in focus group discussions, and 5 CHBC nurses in individual interviews. Caregivers were found challenged by lack of community networks support, inadequate sanitary and care packages, poor shelter compromising privacy, inadequate income and food for their clients, inadequate care motivation as their volunteerism does not attract any payment, inadequate health personnel to offer psychosocial support like counselling, and an unconducive caring environment generally. Putting in place policies to redress caregivers' poverty, helping caregivers start income-generating projects, increasing community assistance and caregiving facilities are recommended as factors to address caregiver challenges.

TI Aspects of the Status of Management Information Systems and the

SO LIBRI
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the status and evaluates the progress made towards the establishment of a management information system (MIS) for public administration in Uganda as well as considering the information needs of public administration in the country. The study focuses on the information systems of two central government ministries, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MFPED), and the local administration of five districts. In addition to a literature review, questionnaires were administered to 530 respondents. Data collected was analysed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The Study reveals that although public administration in Uganda is based on New Public Management (NPM), an approach which exploits IT-based MIS, the information system that is in place is still dependant on printed data. Computer supplies are dismally inadequate, favour central as opposed to local government, and use of basic applications such as word-processing, constitutes the bulk Of Computer competency. Thus, the application of a management information system within a networked-computer environment barely exists. The study recommends developing ICT policy, strengthening MIS training, developing MIS infrastructure and providing and developing sectoral information analysis centres with relevant rights and obligations.

AB This special issue of the journal of Cleaner Production was initiated as a result of the 5th and 6th meetings of the Asia Pacific Roundtable for Sustainable Consumption and Production (APRSCP), which were held in Melbourne, Australia and Hanoi, Vietnam, respectively. A need identified at those meetings was to create another means of communicating the best ideas and papers being presented, to a wider audience. The Asia Pacific region has special development needs given its rapid emergence as a global production hub, but coupled to that are also the rapid social adjustments and shifts in patterns of consumption and production which aren't positive for the environment. This special issue contains eight papers covering the implementation of cleaner production and life cycle principles at the systems and regional planning level. These articles cover urban development, corporate CP programs, supply chain management, eco-industrial networks, and industrial parks, recycling, and understanding the role of human factors in bringing about environmental change.

   update-intensive applications; frequent updates
AB Managing frequent updates is greatly important in many update-intensive applications, such as location-aware services, sensor networks, and stream databases. In this paper, we present an R-tree-based index structure (called R-sb-tree, R-tree with semibulk loading) for efficiently managing frequent updates from massive moving objects. The concept of semibulk loading is exploiting a small in-memory buffer to defer, buffer, and group the incoming updates and bulk-insert these updates simultaneously. With a reasonable memory overhead (typically only 1 percent of the whole data set), the proposed approach far outperforms the previous works in terms of update and query performance as well in a realistic environment. In order to further increase buffer hit ratio for the proposed approach, a new page-replacement policy that exploits the level of buffered node is proposed. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of deferring threshold ratio (dtr) that simply enables deferring CPU-and I/O-intensive operations such as node splits and removals. Extensive experimental evaluation reveals that the proposed approach is far more efficient than previous approaches for managing frequent updates under various settings.

ID CONGESTION CONTROL; TCP VEGAS
AB Today's Internet is well adapted to the evolution of protocols at various network layers. Much of the intelligence of congestion control is delegated to the end users and they have a large amount of freedom in the choice of the protocols they use. In the absence of a centralized policy for a global deployment of a unique protocol to perform a given task, the Internet experiences a competitive evolution between various versions of protocols. The evolution manifests itself through the upgrading of existing protocols, abandonment of some protocols and appearance of new ones. We highlight in this paper the modeling capabilities of the evolutionary game paradigm for explaining past evolution and predicting the future one. In particular, using this paradigm we derive conditions under which (i) a successful protocol would dominate and wipe away other protocols, or (ii) various competing protocols could coexist. In the latter case we also predict the share of users that would use each of the protocols. We further use evolutionary games to propose guidelines for upgrading protocols in order to achieve desirable stability behavior of the system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The present study focuses on developing a conceptual framework that explores the relationships between teachers' intent to leave and a spectrum of ethics perceptions. The authors argue that these relationships are mediated by organizational commitment (affective and normative). Research Design: Organizational ethics was measured by teachers' perceptions of ethical climate (caring and formal), organizational justice (distributive and procedural), and tendency to misbehave. Participants were 1,016 schoolteachers from 35 schools affiliated with a secondary-level school network in Israel. Findings: Results of a multilevel analysis reveal direct relationships between intent to leave and dimensions of all three ethical constructs. The mediation effect of affective and normative commitment was full for caring climate and partial for procedural justice and tendency to misbehave. Conclusions: The contribution of this study is the integrative approach to organizational ethics as predicting teachers' intent to leave, an approach rarely taken in previous research. The results may have implications for educational policies that focus on improving ethical perceptions while containing teachers' voluntary turnover.

AB This paper argues that, since a subsidiary is embedded in a dual context of both the MNE and the host environment, its strategic role should be assessed by its relative positions and contributions both within the knowledge networks of the MNE and the host country. Based on this, we develop a dual-role typology. The 369 multinational subsidiaries in our sample from China can be classified into as many as 12 out of the 16 conceptual groups of the typology. Our results indicate that dual activists (active both internally and externally) account for only 12% of the total sampled multinational subsidiaries while dual loners (inactive both internally and externally) reach 20%. The results from a larger sample by adding 113 minority foreign share firms show that external knowledge links are positively associated with local Chinese ownership. The central message from this paper is that a large proportion of foreign-invested firms in China are inactive in knowledge exchange either internally or externally or both. Managerial and policy implications are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advancing the understanding of spatiotemporal aspects of air pollution in the urban environment is an area where improved methods can be of great benefit to exposure assessment and policy support. This paper explores the potential of a technique known as kriging with external drift (KED) to provide high resolution maps of fine particulate matter for a downtown region of Cusco, Peru. There were three stages in this research. The first was to conduct a pilot level monitoring campaign to investigate ambient, regional, and street-level air pollutant concentrations for particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the Province of Cusco. The second was to compile observations within a geographic information system (GIS) in order to characterize the proximal effect of the local transportation network, elevation, and land use classifications on PM2.5. Third, regression, ordinary kriging and kriging with external drift were used to model PM2.5 for three select time periods during a 24-h day. Statistical evaluations indicate kriging with external drift resulted in the strongest models explaining 64% of variability seen with morning particle concentrations, 25% for afternoon particles, and 53% in evening particles. These models capture spatial and temporal variability for air pollution in Cusco. These variations seem to be influenced, to varying degrees, by elevation, meteorological conditions, spatial location, and transportation characteristics. In conclusion, combining GIS, meteorological data and geostatistics proved to be a complementary suite of tools for incorporating spatiotemporal analysis into the air quality assessment.

AB Just as domestic pollution can cause transnational externalities, domestic environmental regulation can create transnational ripple effects in other jurisdictions. In this Article, I show how chemical regulation-long a weak link in the network of U.S. environmental laws-is about to be reshaped and reformed through the extraterritorial ripple effects of new European Union legislation. Contributing to both international law and environmental law scholarship, this Article shows how transnational information flows can be harnessed to end the longstanding drought of data on chemical toxicity in the United States.
   Part I of this Article critiques the U.S. chemical regulatory regime, arguing that a lack of toxicity testing and high statutory barriers to regulation have created a persistent data gap that has undermined public health and environmental protections. I then argue that the EU legislation offers a superior model for addressing chemical risks. The EU law makes toxicity testing a default requirement for thousands of chemicals produced or imported in Europe, encourages substitution away from hazardous chemicals, and shifts the burden of proof on the safety of the most hazardous classes of chemicals from government to industry. As a result of these innovations, this next-generation chemical regulatory regime rewards knowledge, rather than ignorance.
   In Part II of this Article, I shift to an analysis of transnational interactions in chemical regulation. I demonstrate that "regulatory turbulence" from the EU legislation-extraterritorial political, legal, and commercial effects-is already changing the political and informational terrain for chemical regulation in the United States. Information on chemical risks, disclosed in Europe, will close longstanding data gaps in the United States and will help build support for reform of U.S. law. Even if the United States does not enact major legislative reforms, its chemical marketplace will increasingly be governed by European norms. Chemical regulation is therefore a case study in how transnational law and global information networks are shaping the future of American environmental law.

AB The banking of tissues such bone and skin began in India in the 1980s and 1990s. Although eye banking started in 1945 there was little progress in this field for the next five decades. As part of the IAEA/RCA program to use ionising radiation for the sterilisation of biological tissues in Asia and the Pacific Region, the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in 1986 decided to set up a tissue bank in Mumbai funded by the Government of India. The TMH Tissue Bank became operational in January 1988, and stands as a pioneering effort in the country to provide safe, clinically useful and cost-effective human allografts for transplantation. It uses the IAEA International Standards on Tissue Banking. All the grafts are sterilised terminally by exposure to a dose of 25 kGy of gamma radiation, which has been validated as recommended by the IAEA Code of Practice for the Radiation Sterilisation of Tissues Allografts: Requirements for Validation and Routine Control. The TMH Tissue Bank is registered with the Maharashtra State Health Authorities, and in May 2004, it became India's first Tissue Bank to receive ISO 9001:2000 certification of its Quality Management System. From 1989 to September 2007, the TMH Tissue Bank has supplied 11,369 allografts to 310 surgeons operating in 69 hospitals in Mumbai and 56 hospitals in other parts of India. These numbers have been limited by difficulties with the retrieval of tissues from deceased donors due to inadequate resources and tissue donation policies of hospitals. As the Government of India representative in the IAEA program, the TMH Tissue Bank has promoted and co-coordinated these activities in the country and the development of tissue banks using radiation sterilisation of tissue grafts. Towards this end it has been engaged in training personnel, drawing up project proposals, and supporting the establishment of a Tissue Retrieval Centre in Mumbai. Currently it networks with the Zonal Transplant Co-ordination Centre of the Government of Maharashtra, and the newly instituted National Deceased Donor Transplantation Network, which will work with the Government of India to set up rules and regulations for organ and tissue donation and transplantation.

TI Fertility beyond the frontier: indigenous women, fertility, and

AB Recent research suggests that after decades of population decline, indigenous populations of the lowland tropics of Latin America are now experiencing rapid growth. At the same time, conservationists have pronounced indigenous lands as a key to the future of Amazon forests. As such, conservationists should have a good understanding of indigenous demography and impacts on conservation and development. Yet, there is little depth to understanding of these demographic changes and a dearth of quantitative research on the reproductive practices of indigenous populations. This study addresses these gaps through analyses of a household survey of 648 women of reproductive age from five distinct ethnic populations in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We estimate fertility, analyze reproductive intentions and contraceptive use, and determine the unmet need for reproductive health services. The analyses confirm high fertility rates and high levels of unmet need for contraception. With regard to program and policy implications, we conclude by arguing that isolation and cultural barriers present unique challenges to meet the reproductive health needs of these populations. Innovative approaches, such as those merging population-health-environment topics, may be most relevant for meeting these challenges.

AB This paper provides an overview of the evidence and applied literature on medical migration. The economic impacts of medical migration have been little researched, causing a polarisation in the debate between its critics and its proponents. The paucity of quantitative studies may be explained by the lack of comprehensive and consistent data. Investments in statistical resources on medical migration are therefore a major priority. The available evidence suggests that particularly English-speaking countries in Sub-Saharan African countries and the Caribbean with relatively few health workers and a high disease burden suffer most from the medical brain drain. However, the exodus of health workers is not the main cause of the health status crisis, but rather a symptom of deeper underlying problems, which often extend beyond the health sector towards the broader economic and political environment. In such situations, medical brain drain does pose challenges for human resource management and health service delivery. The only effective and long-term sustainable policy is one that addresses the underlying push and pull factors. Reforms have to be country-led, but may be supported via temporary migration schemes, remittances, enhancement of diaspora networks, and financial aid for which a strong moral case exists.

TI Environmental health in Croatia - current status and perspectives
SO PERIODICUM BIOLOGORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB The existing environmental health system in Croatia is based on the Andrija Stampar's principles of public health and oil additional changes and improvements occurred as apart of the EU accession process. However; in in-depth analysis of the environmental health situation in Croatia, it is important to evaluate not only the essential policies and transposed EU Legislation, but also all other management instruments important for appropriate functions of the system. Due to the lack of appropriate horizontal collaboration of different ministries, there are "vertical" laws and bylaws generating duplication and overlapping of responsibilities, as well as the lack of the appropriate capacities for law enforcement and implementation. Existing network of County Institutes of Public Health headed by the Croatian National Institute of Public Health, as well as other institutions and organizations specifically involved in environmental and health issues should engage more intersectoral and interdisciplinary, approach involving other sectors from society, as one of the main preconditions for sucessful implementation of National Environmental health information system, as well as to establish an independent environment health professional association, so a sustainable inter-sectoral environmental health system could be built up. There are many other supporting programmes that may help Croatia in accomplishing this task, such as EU pre-accession programme and various bilateral programmes from different EU Member States.

AB In this paper we present the results of the first phase of the project Who is Who in Brazilian Environmental Health. The aim of this project is to identify and characterize the Academic Groups and Civil Society Organizations acting on the field of environmental health that are able to contribute both to the strengthening of its technical and scientific basis, and to the dialogue with organized civil society. The identification took place through the data source available at CNPq (Research Groups Directory), ABONG (Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations), FBOMS (Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for Environment and Sustainable Development) and RBJA (Brazilian Network for Environmental Justice). The results were presented and discussed based on time evolution, geographic distribution and areas of research and action. Final considerations point to the great potential for dialogue between experts and non experts, governmental and non-governmental, in order to create the foundation for a extended peer community capable of combining policies, knowledge, technologies and actions, seeking the comprehension and search of solutions to the establishment of health as a prerequisite and X a result of well being and full life.

DE civil organizations; civil participation; public consultation; civil
   consultation forums
AB Role of civil organizations in the last twenty years in the environmental issues resulted the development of the green NGO network. It generated new forms of cooperation after the EU accession. Thank for community policies which support the democratic decision - making processes, the decision makers make the processes of programs, strategies, action plans of the 2007-2013 budgeting period public. During the public consultation processes, civil organizations can submit and forward their suggestions in different conciliatory forums and can get information about the EU projects. The establishment of the civil conciliatory forums assisted the civil integration process, the enforcement of the principle of partnership and made the decision - making processes more effective. The developed mechanisms have gradually evolved by the summer of 2008, but after the public consultation of the second action plan it failed, lost its significance. If the civil actors who are involved into the decision - making processes are not able to "grow up", and have appropriate professional background, their proposals, recommendations will be cancelled by the decision makers, will not be incorporated into the programs and the whole civil participation will be unnecessary as we experienced in the case of the Southern-Transdanubia region.

AB Policy initiatives to deconcentrate poverty through mixed-income redevelopment were motivated in part by the desire to reduce social isolation and social disorganization in high-poverty neighborhoods. This article examines whether the presence of higher-income neighbors decreased social isolation or improved social organization in a Boston public housing project that was redeveloped into a HOPE VI mixed-income community. Based on in-depth interviews and neighborhood observation, I find that it was the lower-income former public housing residents who were primarily involved in creating neighborhood-based social ties, providing and receiving social support, and enforcing social control within the neighborhood, rather than the higher-income newcomers. This variation in neighborhood engagement stemmed from the different ways that long-term and newer residents perceived and interpreted their neighborhood surroundings. These differences were generated by residents' comparisons of current and past neighborhood environments and by neighborhood reputations. Residents' perceptions of place may thus influence whether mixed-income redevelopment can reduce social isolation and improve social organization in high-poverty neighborhoods and, more generally, whether changes in neighborhood structural characteristics translate into changes in social dynamics.

AB The dramatic decline in the presence of farmland birds during recent decades has provoked much attention in agri-environmental policy and ecological research. However, the still limited understanding of the socio-economical mechanisms that govern the decline in bird presence hampers the formulation of effective adjustments in land-use and farming practices that could support the return of birds to farmland, i.e. the required fine-tuning of management practices. As a consequence, the existing agri-environmental schemes that offer financial compensation to farmers for implementing generally simple and rather crude measures to stimulate the presence of birds have been limited in their effectiveness and subject to much debate. The objective of this paper is to provide a sociological appraisal of farmers' experiences with meadow bird protection in a mainly dairy farming area in the Netherlands. The methodology combined visual map analysis, surveys, interviews with farmers and experts, and monitoring farmers' discussions. The results allowed an assessment of (i) farmers' views on historical changes in bird numbers in the area and the current distribution of bird nests. (ii) locally adjusted, fine-tuned management practices that were considered to be promising for protecting bird nests, (iii) the importance of farm management with 'an eye for birds', i.e. farmers and/or birdwatchers paying additional attention to the presence of nests and chicks before carrying out farming activities, and (iv) the views of key experts in the socio-institutional network in the case study area. The paper concludes that there are various promising options for fine-tuning farm management so it offers better bird protection, but it is expected that such measures will predominantly be adopted on less intensively managed farms.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool that can be used to evaluate the environmental load of a product, process, or activity throughout its life cycle. Today's LCA users are a mixture of individuals with skills in different disciplines who want to evaluate their products, processes, or activities in a life cycle context. This study attempts to present some of the LCA studies on agricultural and industrial food products, recent advances in LCA and their application on food products. The reviewed literatures indicate that agricultural production is the hotspot in the life cycle of food products and LCA can assist to identify more sustainable options. Due to the recent development of LCA methodologies and dissemination programs by international and local bodies, use of LCA is rapidly increasing in agricultural and industrial food products. A network of information sharing and exchange of experience has expedited the LCA development process. The literatures also suggest that LCA coupled with other approaches provides much more reliable and comprehensive information to environmentally conscious policy makers, producers, and consumers in selecting sustainable products and production processes. Although LCA methodologies have been improved, further international standardization would broaden its practical applications, improve the food security and reduce human health risk.

AB A growing number of regulatory interventions such as the European Union's Extended Polluter Responsibility Policy hold manufacturers accountable for the damage inflicted to the natural environment by their products. However, not all components of an industrial product have an equitable role regarding their overall burden to the environment. In this context, it is of great interest to manufacturers to identify and rank those components with the highest potential value at the end of their useful life, employing an array of economical and environmental criteria. In order to assist manufacturers on their decision-making for the optimal end-of-life alternatives for their products, the "Multicriteria Matrix" methodology has been developed. The methodology relies on multicriteria analysis and takes into consideration the residual weight, quantity and ease of disassembly of each component. With the environmental burden value,, developed methodology only those components that do not have any residual value end up in landfills, while the majority of the components are either reused or recycled. The application of the developed methodology is demonstrated employing a real-world case study; that of an ISDN network terminal. Finally, the paper is concluded by presenting interesting managerial insights that were obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Power and environment aware control of Beowulf clusters
SO CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND
   APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Cluster; Dynamic power management; Efficiency; High performance
   computing; Reliability
AB Beowulf clusters are now deployed worldwide, chiefly in support of scientific computing. Beowulf clusters yield high computing performance, yet they also pose several challenges: (1) heat-induced hardware failure makes large scale commodity clusters fail quite frequently and (2) cost effectiveness of the Beowulf cluster is challenged by the fact that it lacks means of adapting its power state according to varying work load. This paper addresses these issues by developing a Power and Environment Awareness Module (PEAM) for a Beowulf cluster. The busty nature of computation load in an academic environment inspired the implementation and analysis of a fixed timeout Dynamic Power Management (DPM) policy. Today it is common that many Beowulf clusters in academic environment are composed of older, recycled nodes that may lack of out-of-band management technologies, thus Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) and Wake-on-LAN (WOL) technology is exploited to control the power state of cluster nodes. A data center environment monitoring system that uses Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology is developed and deployed to realize environment awareness of the cluster. Our PEAM module has been implemented on our cluster at Purdue University, reducing the operational cost and increasing the reliability of the cluster by reducing heat generation and optimizing workload distribution in an environment aware manner.

ID PROMOTING SAFE WALKING; PUBLIC-HEALTH; URBAN SPRAWL; OBESITY; SCHOOL
AB Background: Jackson, Michigan (population 36,000) started active living interventions to help solve residents' low physical activity levels. Jackson's experience can serve as a case study for beginning similar efforts in smaller communities. Methods: In 2003, Jackson began a 3-prong community intervention utilizing the 5P model to increase safe physical activity opportunities and encourage walking and biking for short trips. The focus included work on projects at) elementary schools, 2) worksites, and 3) city-wide networks. Results: Evaluation results show changes in attitudes toward active transportation (8% increase in children who thought walking to school was "safer" postintervention), intentions to try active transportation (43% of Smart Commute Day participants "would" smart commute more often postevent), and increased physical activity (the percentage of students walking to school more than doubled at 3 of 4 intervention schools). In addition, a community level observational study was conducted at 10 locations in the city in 2005 and 2006. The number of people seen using active transportation increased from 1,028 in 2005 to 1,853 people in 2006 (a 63% increase). Conclusions: Local community-driven projects to increase walking and biking can be effective by utilizing a variety of interventions, from the individual to the policy level.

DE Ruby; Linda; dRuby; Rinda; TupleSpace; RMI
AB The object-oriented scripting language Ruby is admired by many programmers for being easy to write in, and for its flexible, dynamic nature. In the last few years, the Ruby on Rails web application framework, popular for its productivity benefits, has brought about a renewed attention to Ruby for enterprise use. As the focus of Ruby has broadened from small tools and scripts, to large applications, the demands on Ruby's distributed object environment have also increased, as has the need for information about its usage, performance and examples of common practices. dRuby and Rinda were developed by the author as the distributed object environment and shared tuplespace implementation for the Ruby language, and are included as part of Ruby's standard library. dRuby extends method calls across the network while retaining the benefits of Ruby. Rinda builds on dRuby to bring the functionality of Linda, the glue language for distributed co-ordination systems, to Ruby. This article discusses the design policy and implementation points of these two systems, and demonstrates their simplicity with sample code and examples of their usage in actual applications. In addition to dRuby and Rinda's appropriateness for prototyping distributed systems, this article will also demonstrate that dRuby and Rinda are building a reputation for being suitable infrastructure components for real-world applications.

AB Objectives. Societies that foster socially Supportive networks produce healthier populations. Social support is a significant determinant of health among Canada's Inuit population: however, little is known about the characteristics that provide access to social Support among Inuit. This exploratory analysis describes how 4 types of social support (namely, positive social interaction. emotional support, tangible support and affection and intimacy) differ in relation to various determinants of health.
   Study design. Micro-data from the Arctic supplement of the 2001 Aboriginal Peoples Survey (n=26,290) was used.
   Methods. Cross-tabulations and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine levels (high/low) of the 4 types of social Support among the full Inuit sample (n=26,290) as they relate to age, vender, geographic re-ion, marital status. Aboriginal language use and participation in traditional harvesting activities.
   Results. Certain subsegments of the Inuit population were less likely to report high levels of Social Support, including men, the elderly (aged 55+) and the unmarried. Some Inuit-relevant determinants were also found to decrease the odds of reporting high levels of social Support, including being Unable to speak or Understand an Aboriginal language, not participating traditional harvesting activities and living in Nunavik.
   Conclusions. Research that frames Inuit health within the social determinants of health is in its relative infancy; however, evidence from the social epidemiological literature indicates that those with diminished access to social Support also suffer poorer health Outcomes. Future research Should build on the findings of this study to examine how the relationship between various health outcomes (e.g., respiratory disease, suicide attempts, self-rated health) and social support may respond along a social gradient. Such analysis will build Oil the paucity of literature specific to Inuit health and social conditions and set priorities for policy and programming efforts that will improve the social determinants of Inuit health.

AB This paper describes findings from an ethics education project funded by the Canadian Stem Cell Network (SCN). The project is part of a larger research initiative entitled "The Stem Cell Research Environment: Drawing the Evidence and Experience Together". The ethics education study began with a series of focus groups with SCN researchers and trainees as part of a "needs assessment" effort. The purpose of these discussions was to identify the main ethical issues associated with stem cell (SC) research from the perspective of the stem cell community. This paper will focus on five prominent themes that emerged from the focus group data including: (1) the source of stem cells; (2) the power of stem cells; (3) working within a charged research environment; (4) the regulatory context; and (5) ethics training for scientists. Additional discussions are planned with others involved in Canadian stem cell research (e.g., research ethics board members, policy makers) to supplement initial findings. These assessment results combined with existing bioethics literature will ultimately inform a web-based ethics education module for the SCN. We believe that our efforts are important for those analyzing the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) in this area because our in depth understanding of stem cell researcher perspectives will enable us to develop more relevant and effective education material, which in turn should help SC researchers address the important ethical challenges in their area.

AB Tropical deforestation and habitat fragmentation in areas around conservation areas have been an important element for discussion in the conservation and policy-making community. In this paper, we evaluate land cover change processes around one of the most important tropical dry forest reserves in the Americas: the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The analysis is conducted at three scales: regional scale (coast of the State of Jalisco), proximity to the reserve (via a 30-km buffer zone analysis), and inside the Biosphere Reserve. The proximity analysis is complemented by a unique data set that represents the extent and boundaries of Ejidos (local land management units) in the region. Results indicate that areas surrounding the reserve have low deforestation, with Ejidos and buffer areas having more forest cover as they get closer to the reserve. The nature of this important phenomenon is discussed in the context of the socio-economic conditions of the local communities. Our work suggests that the creation of a network of "Ejidos' Conservation Areas", in the context of an approach that will recognize payments for environmental services provided to local communities, could contribute to the conservation and maintenance of the rich biodiversity in a region that has one of the highest levels of endemism in the world.

AB In the light of concerns about the wider social and economic value of the PhD training programme, this article discusses the challenges being directed primarily at the traditional doctoral programme of study. While the PhD is primarily concerned with the student making an original contribution to knowledge, the value-added component of the doctoral research degree needs to respond to the needs of a wider market of purchasers, and to meet practice and policy requirements for research leadership. The United Kingdom Research Councils (UK GRAD, 2001 Joint Skills Statement of Skills Training Requirements. Available at http://www.grad.ac.uk/downloads/documents/general/Joint%20Skills%20Statement.pdf (last accessed 1st April 2008) suggest a range of seven skit( domains over and above research design and management that should be offered to students. The seven domains are research skills and techniques, participation in the research environment, research management, personal effectiveness, communication, networking and team working, and career management. This article develops and extends these skit[ domains for the current healthcare context and considers how these should guide the development and evaluation of the value-added components of doctoral research degree programmes in nursing. The challenges that these issues present to academic departments are also discussed. Our conclusion is that PhD research training needs re-visioning and broadening so that the students' experience includes these value-added components. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper it to outline current resource-sharing initiatives in Irish academic libraries that support increased research activity in line with national policy. This paper aims to point to the challenges and opportunities such initiatives present.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a review paper based on practice.
   Findings - It has been suggested that the greatest obstacle to finding library research is that librarians do not publish their research. As financial constraints impact on all publicly funded organisations it is not unreasonable to suggest that decision making will become more dependent on research evidence than previously. Economies of scale cannot justify the development of a research body such as the Research Information Network (RIN) in the UK and, while its output is relevant to higher education in Ireland, it is important to remember that its findings must be adapted and scaled to the Irish environment, and that partnerships and collaboration may result in different dynamics from those in a larger polity. It is therefore important that Irish research is documented and published, so that it helps map the information landscape which supports the research agenda and the national interest.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a synthesis of current practice, outlining current shortcomings and challenges. it will be of interest to all librarians concerned to learn more about resource sharing in the British Isles and in particular in the Republic of Ireland.

AB In a community-directed forest management context, research is needed that will help both the managers of forest resources and the community residents who set forest management directions to consider climate change in their decision making. Specific research needed in light of climate change to support implementation of the forest management plan for the Champagne and Aishihik Traditional Territory, southwest Yukon, was identified through 1) sessions with local forest practitioners and 2) a community climate change workshop. Local residents highlighted the importance of formalizing a monitoring network based on local knowledge as part of a broader adaptive management framework. They also wanted an important role in any discussion on adapting existing forest management plans, practices, and policies to incorporate climate change considerations. Forest practitioners expressed a need for research to identify forest management tactics that would enable them to achieve community-directed forest management objectives in light of climate change. Addressing these research needs will have benefits beyond just adapting forest management to climate change. Climate change is providing the impetus and a forum for discussing a broader issue: the need for a more comprehensive research and monitoring program to support the sustainable management of forest resources.

TI Finescale Evaluation of Drought in a Tropical Setting: Case Study in Sri
   Lanka
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
LA English

ID INDIAN-OCEAN; MONSOON RAINFALL; ENSO; INDEXES
AB In regions of climatic heterogeneity, finescale assessment of drought risk is needed for policy making and drought management, mitigation, and adaptation. The relationship between drought relief payments (a proxy for drought risk) and meteorological drought indicators is examined through a retrospective analysis for Sri Lanka (1960-2000) based on records of district-level drought relief payments and a dense network of 284 rainfall stations. The standardized precipitation index and a percent-of-annual-average index for rainfall accumulated over 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were used, gridded to a spatial resolution of 10 km. An encouraging correspondence was identified between the spatial distribution of meteorological drought occurrence and historical drought relief payments at the district scale. Time series of drought indices averaged roughly over the four main climatic zones of Sri Lanka showed statistically significant (p < 0.01) relationships with the occurrence of drought relief. The 9-month cumulative drought index provided the strongest relationships overall, although 6- and 12-month indicators provided generally similar results. Some cases of appreciable drought without corresponding relief payments could be attributed to fiscal pressures, as during the 1970s. Statistically significant relationships between drought indicators and relief payments point to the potential utility of meteorological drought assessments for disaster risk management. In addition, the study provides an empirical approach to testing which meteorological drought indicators bear a statistically significant relationship to drought relief across a wide range of tropical climates.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of donation behavior and identify reasons, beliefs and feelings relative to this practice, based on the reports of donor women. Personal and social-environmental aspects, which seem to affect donation behavior in donors and former donors, were also investigated.
   METHODS: An exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out with women donors at two breast-milk banks within the public health system of the Brazilian Federal District. Data was collected from July to September 2005. The participants were 36 women, aged 14 to 33 years (average= 24.78; SD= 5.22), with different levels of schooling, 58.3% of which were first-time mothers. Data gathering was based on interviews carried out during home visits. In addition to descriptive statistical analyses of quantitative data, a qualitative data categorical analysis was also performed.
   RESULTS: The most frequently reported reasons for donating breast milk were altruism and excess milk production. The most frequent time interval for donation was 13 days after delivery. Contact by phone with the milk bank was the most common means of communication used by the majority of participants (n= 22) to obtain information that enabled the donating process.
   CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial aspects identified and the experience of donors can contribute to the empowerment of the formal and informal social donation-support network, in addition to serving as a driver for the implementation of technical and policy strategies in promoting future donation practices.

AB There are many factors influencing the current global interest in the biorefining of biomass feedstocks to produce a wide variety of extracts, fuels and chemicals. Identifying renewable sources of target molecules currently produced from fossil fuels is one of these, which will ultimately have a positive impact on climate change. Another driver is identifying potential uses for land masses, where a low GDP is affecting communities in those areas. From a UK perspective, a decline in total income generated from farming in Wales has had a detrimental impact on many communities right across the Principality.
   There is a considerable body of data to argue that with effective land use and the use of a range of enzymic and chemical processing technologies, the utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for a biorefining industry would result in both social and economic regeneration of these rural communities.
   In order to create a sustainable biorefining in Wales, alongside regeneration of the rural economy there is a requirement for expansion of the high technology skill base, in areas such as chemistry, biotechnology and engineering.
   The key to developing this sustainable and economically viable biorefining industry within Wales and ultimately in the UK is based on several technical issues which need to be addressed. These include ensuring that the feedstocks can be grown on marginal land which will not therefore compete with traditional food crops, the need to create local supply chains linking regions together, but which can also feed into the rapidly expanding networks of biomass-based industrial activity in other areas of the UK, and ensuring that the existing transport infrastructure can absorb this increase in activity.
   This paper will consider the options for large scale biorefining of high sugar perennial ryegrasses in Wales, as a model for producing sustainable, bulk quantities of chemicals, including biofuels. (C) 2009 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper puts together an analytical formulation to compute optimal tolls for multiclass traffic. The formulation is comprised of two major modules. The first one is an optimization component aimed at computing optimal tolls assuming a Stackelberg game in which the toll agency sets the tolls, and the equilibrating traffic plays the role of the followers. The optimization component is supported by a set of cost models that estimate the externalities as a function of a multivariate vector of traffic flows. These models were estimated using Taylor series expansions of the output obtained from traffic simulations of a hypothetical test case. Of importance to the paper is the total travel time function estimated using this approach that expresses total travel time as a multivariate function of the traffic volumes. The formulation presented in the paper is then applied to a variety of scenarios to gain insight into the optimality of current toll policies. The optimal tolls are computed for two different cases: independent tolls, and tolls proportional to passenger car equivalencies (PCE).
   The numerical results clearly show that setting tolls proportional to PCEs leads to lower values of welfare that are on average 15% lower than when using independent tolls, though, in some cases the total welfare could be up to 33% lower. This is a consequence of two factors. First, the case of independent tolls has more degrees of freedom than the case of tolls proportional to PCEs. Second, tolls proportional to PCEs do not account for externalities other than congestion, which is likely to lead to lower welfare values.
   The analytical formulations and numerical results indicate that, because the total travel time is a non-linear function of the traffic volumes, the marginal social costs and thus the optimal congestion tolls also depend on the traffic volumes for each vehicle class. As a result of this, for the relatively low volumes of truck traffic observed in real life, the optimal congestion tolls for trucks could indeed be either lower or about the same as for passenger cars. This stand in sharp contrast with what is implied in the use of PCEs, i.e., that the contribution to congestion are constant. This latter assumption leads to optimal truck congestion tolls that are always proportional to the PCE values.
   The comparison of the toll ratios (truck tolls divided by passenger car tolls) for both observed and optimal conditions suggests that the tolls for small trucks are about the right level, maybe a slightly lower than optimal. However, the analysis of the toll ratio for large trucks seems to indicate a significant overcharge, The estimates show that the average observed toll ratio for large trucks is even higher than the maximum optimal toll ratio found in the numerical experiments. This suggests that the tolls for large trucks are set oil the basis of revenue generation principles while the passenger car tolls are being set based oil a mild form of welfare maximization. This leads to a suboptimal cross-subsidization of passenger car traffic in detriment of an important sector of the economy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Retirement villages have been slow to emerge as a housing model for older people in the United Kingdom (UK) but the sector is now growing rapidly, with all increasing number of both private and not-for-profit developers entering the market. Research findings to date have indicated high levels of satisfaction among residents, but commentators have criticised this form of provision on the grounds that they are only an option For the better off. This paper reports 21 Study of a retirement village that has attempted to address this issue by integrating residents from a range or socio-economic backgrounds and by making various tenures available ill the same development. The paper begins With a brief history or retirement villages ill the UK and an overview of the concept or community, including those Of communities Of place and interest and their role in social policy. The presented findings highlight a number of factors that impact on a resident's sense of community, including social interaction, the development or friendships, the built environment and the existence of common interests. The discussion focuses On the development of cross-tenure social networks and how residents health and social status shapes community experience. It is concluded that the clustering model of mixed tenure is likely to emphasise differences in the socio-economic backgrounds or residents and that the Success of retirement villages as communities depends on grasping the subtleties of the diversity or later life.

AB This paper addresses intertwined issues in the conceptualization, implementation and evaluation of multilevel dynamic systems intervention science (MDSIS). Interventions are systematically planned, conducted and evaluated social science-based cultural products intercepting the lives of people and institutions in the context of multiple additional events and processes (which also may be referred to as interventions) that may speed, slow or reduce change towards a desired outcome. Multilevel interventions address change efforts at multiple social levels in the hope that effects at each level will forge synergistic links, facilitating movement toward desired change. This paper utilizes an ecological framework that identifies macro (policy and regulatory institutions), meso (organizations and agencies with resources, and power) and micro (individuals, families and friends living in communities) interacting directly and indirectly. An MDSIS approach hypothesizes that change toward a goal will occur faster and more effectively when synchronized and supported across levels in a social system. MDSIS approaches by definition involve "whole" communities and cannot be implemented without the establishments of working community partnerships This paper takes a dynamic systems approach to science as conducted in communities, and discusses four concepts that are central to MDSIS-science, community, culture, and sustainability. These concepts are important in community based participatory research and to the targeting, refinement, and adaptation of enduring interventions. Consistency in their meaning and use can promote forward movement in the field of MDSIS, and in community-based prevention science.

AB We consider a multi-stage inventory system composed of a single warehouse that receives a single product from a single supplier and replenishes the inventory of n retailers through direct shipments. Fixed costs are incurred for each truck dispatched and all trucks have the same capacity limit. Costs are stationary, or more generally monotone as in Lippman (Management Sci 16, 1969, 118-138). Demands for the n retailers over a planning horizon of T periods are given. The objective is to find the shipment quantities over the planning horizon to satisfy all demands at minimum system-wide inventory and transportation costs without acklogging. Using the structural properties of optimal solutions, we develop (1) an O(T-2) algorithm for the single-stage dynamic lot sizing problem; (2) an O(T-3) algorithm for the case of a single-warehouse single-retailer system; and (3) a nested shortest-path algorithm for the single-warehouse multi-retailer problem that runs in polynomial time for a given number of retailers. To overcome the computational burden when the number of retailers is large, we propose aggregated and disaggregated Lagrangian decomposition methods that make use of the structural properties and the efficient single-stage algorithm. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of these algorithms and the gains associated with coordinated versus decentralized systems. Finally, we show that the decentralized solution is asymptotically optimal. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 56: 450-464, 2009

TI Indigenous yak and yak-cattle crossbreed management in high altitude
   areas of northern Nepal: A case study from Rasuwa district
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Indigenous knowledge; yak and hybrids; management system
AB This paper summarizes and documents the indigenous yak and chauri managements in high altitude mountainous areas of Nepal through on-the-spot surveys on the farmers from three villages of case study site, Rasuwa district, 35 households were surveyed with open-ended and pre-tested questionnaires, 20 key persons were interviewed with face-to-face conversation and 47 participants were involved in participatory rural assessment (PRA), transhumance characterized by the seasonal movements of livestock between different ecological belts is key grazing pattern in the case sites. Rotational grazing of the pasturelands according to feed availability is the example of deployment of indigenous knowledge adapted by local farmers. Cross breeding of yak with cattle (Tibetan cattle bull or Zebu cattle cow) is popular in traditional herd farming system. The breeding patterns in local yak farming systems reflect the seasonal availability and climatic variation, matching very well to transhumant grazing strategies. Supplementing the herd with a small amount of concentrates in harsh lean period is the traditional feeding management. F1 hybrid calf is carefully reared and F2 hybrid calf is killed by carelessly rearing is an indigenous practice to improve the herd productivity. Careful grazing management and herbal remedies for various diseases, pests and plant poisoning are good examples of indigenous knowledge in animal health care, although the interview and survey results indicate that most farmers believe their indigenous livestock managements are moderately efficient, there are still some problems and limitations for optimizing their yak and chauri management systems. More public supports are expected by local farmers to improve yak and chauri production systems, the potential indigenous industries in remote mountainous areas. It can be recommended and suggested from this case study that making better use of the vast indigenous knowledge that the local farmers possess is necessary when making improved management plans for yak and chauri farming system. Participatory research, policy-making and extension network should be developed to encourage the farmers to work together with professionals for better integrating the indigenous skills with advanced technologies. Indigenous institution development and farmers' capacity building are imperative for better planning and successful implementation of livestock management program.

AB Corporate approaches to improve environmental performance cannot be undertaken in isolation. so a concerted effort along the supply chain (SC) entities is needed which poses another important challenge to managers. This work addresses the optimization of SC planning and design considering economical and environmental issues. The strategic decisions considered in the model are facility location, processing technology selection and production-distribution planning. A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is envisaged to incorporate the environmental aspects of the model. IMPACT 2002+ methodology is selected to perform the impact assessment within the SC thus providing a feasible implementation of a combined midpoint-endpoint evaluation. The proposed approach reduces the value-subjectivity inherent to the assignment of weights in the calculation of an overall environmental impact by considering endpoint damage categories as objective function. Additionally, the model performs an impact mapping along the comprising SC nodes and activities. Such mapping allows to focus financial efforts to reduce environmental burdens to the most promising subjects. Furthermore, consideration of CO2 trading scheme and temporal distribution of environmental interventions are also included with the intention of providing a tool that may be utilized to evaluate current regulatory policies or pursue more effective ones. The mathematical formulation of this problem becomes a multi-objective MILP (moMILP). Criteria selected for the objective function are damage categories impacts, overall impact factor and net present value (NPV). Main advantages of this model are highlighted through a realistic case study of maleic anhydride SC production and distribution network. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction and Aims. The mainstay of drug control in China is compulsory incarceration and detoxification, but relapse rates following release are very high. The aim of the study was to explore factors which would help prevent relapse in injecting drug users following release from detoxification centres. Design and Methods. Semi-structured interviews were carried out at three compulsory detoxification centres in Derhong prefecture, Yunnan Province, which has the highest proportion of injecting drug users in China. Results. Interviews were completed with 235 men and 125 women aged between 15 and 64 years. They had been injecting heroine for between 3 months and 25 years; the median number of times of previous compulsory detoxification was four, with 11% having undergone this more than 10 times. All but six wanted to quit permanently, but almost all acknowledged that relapse on release was almost inevitable. The month immediately following release was identified as most vulnerable time for relapse. Respondents identified three measures which would help decrease the rate of relapse. First, the environment of the detoxification centres should emphasise support and counselling rather than punishment. Second, families should be provided with support to help the user immediately after release. Third, arrangements could be made to help those individuals who request relocation, to find work elsewhere away from accustomed drug-using social networks. Discussion and Conclusions. While a combination of these measures could help in some way to reduce rates of relapse following detention, given the failure of the detoxification/detention regimes to reduce drug use, consideration must be given to other approaches.

AB Managing a watershed for satisfying the inhabitant's demand is a difficult task if one has to maintain a reasonable balance between usually conflicting environmental flows and demands. The solution to these complex issues requires the use of mathematical techniques to take into account conflicting objectives. Many optimization models exist for general management systems but there is a knowledge gap in linking practical problems with the optimum use of all land resources under conflicting demands in a watershed. In the present study, an optimization problem has been formulated for the Brimvand watershed, Iran, comprising ca. 9572 ha to find out the most suitable land allocation to different land uses, viz. orchard, irrigated farming, dry farming and rangeland targeting soil erosion minimization and benefit maximization.
   Soil erosion, net benefit and land capability maps were provided as inputs to formulate the objective functions and governing constraints in a multiobjectives linear optimization problem. The problem was then solved using the simplex method with the help of ADBASE software package and the optimal solution was ultimately determined. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was also conducted to recognize more effective land use in reducing soil erosion and increasing benefit. The results of the study revealed that the amount of soil erosion and benefit could, respectively reduce and increase to the tune of 7.9 and 18.6%, in case of implementing optimal allocation of the study land uses. The results of sensitivity analyses also showed that the objective functions were strongly susceptible to the constraint of maximum summation of irrigated farming and orchard areas.

AB Habitat fragmentation is the focus of much conservation concerti and associated research. In some countries, Such as Britain, the main phase of fragmentation Occurred centuries ago and the focus of conservation management is now oil restoration and recovery. Scenario studies have Suggested that spatial targeting is preferable if landscape scale restoration is to be achieved, and that this should bring greater benefits than site-focussed activities but this has rarely been tested in practice. In Britain, woodland expansion has been encouraged through a number of financial incentives, which have evolved from instruments that encouraged almost any addition to the potential woodland resource, to grant schemes that have set out to restore connectivity to remnant ancient woodland. This study assessed the degree of de-fragmentation achieved by woodland expansion on the Isle of Wight and in particular the success of spatial targeting of new woodland planting implemented through grant aid ill the JIGSAW (Joining and Increasing Grant. Scheme for Ancient Woodland) scheme. Five steps in the re-development of broad-leaved woodland were tested using eight indicators - six commonly used landscape metrics, and two ecologically scaled indicators derived from application of least-cost network evaluation. Only half of the measures indicated de-fragmentation over the whole sequence of five steps. However, the spatial targeting did appear Successful, When compared to equivalent untargeted grant-aided woodland expansion, and resulted in positive change to six of the eight indicators. We discuss the utility of the indicators and ways in Which future targeting could be supported by their application. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Communication and Interpretation of Results of Route Risk Analyses of
   Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English

ID RAILWAY TANK CARS; SHIPMENTS; DESIGN
AB Route risk analysis of hazardous materials transportation by railroad is receiving considerable new attention from industry and government. Such analyses are necessary for effective public policy and development of rational risk management strategies. However, route risk analysis is complex and generates results that can be difficult to properly interpret. Risk analyses are intended to provide risk managers with objective information about how to effectively manage risk and the most effective options to reduce it. This paper uses results from a quantitative risk analysis of hazardous materials shipped by rail to develop and illustrate several new techniques to present, interpret, and communicate risk results more effectively. The analysis accounted for the major factors affecting risk: infrastructure quality, traffic volume, and population exposure along shipment routes, as well as tank car design and product characteristics. Approaches for system-level and route-specific analyses are presented. Both absolute and normalized estimates of risk provide useful information. The question of interest and the user affects which type of information is most useful for effective decision making. Various graphical techniques enable risk metrics to be compared and contrasted, either in a geographic context or independent of it, depending on which is most useful. Identifying the locations that account for the highest concentration of risk and understanding the contributing factors will also clarify the mutual roles of carriers, shippers, and municipalities along a route in regard to risk management, reduction, and mitigation options. In addition, the techniques presented in this paper may also be useful for regulators and researchers who might be interested in a broader view of risk analysis at the network level.

AB The MOCEH study is a prospective hospital- and community-based cohort study designed to collect information related to environmental exposures (chemical, biological, nutritional, physical, and psychosocial) during pregnancy and childhood and to examine how exposure to environmental pollutants affects growth, development, and disease. The MOCEH network includes one coordinating center, four local centers responsible for recruiting pregnant women, and four evaluation centers (a nutrition center, bio-repository center, neurocognitive development center, and environment assessment center). At the local centers, trained nurses interview the participants to gather information regarding their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, complications related to the current gestation period, health behaviors and environmental factors. These centers also collect samples of blood, placenta, urine, and breast milk. Environmental hygienists measure each participant's level of exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants during the pre- and postnatal periods. The participants are followed up through delivery and until the child is 5 years of age. The MOCEH study plans to recruit 1,500 pregnant women between 2006 and 2010 and to perform follow-up studies on their children. We expect this study to provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the gestational environment has an effect on the development of diseases during adulthood. We also expect the study results to enable evaluation of latency and age-specific susceptibility to exposure to hazardous environmental pollutants, evaluation of growth retardation focused on environmental and genetic risk factors, selection of target environmental diseases in children, development of an environmental health index, and establishment of a national policy for improving the health of pregnant women and their children.

AB Purpose - The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between employee perceptions of their organization's management of cultural diversity, their perceived organizational support and affective commitment.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was developed and distributed to a sample of employees working in a large Australian financial institution.
   Findings - Analysis of the data shows that, when controlling for perceived organizational support, there is no direct relationship between cultural diversity management perceptions and affective commitment. Rather, the data support an indirect relationship between the two variables via perceived organizational support.
   Research limitations/implications - Implications are, first, that managers need to recognize the potential contribution of developing a positive workplace atmosphere for cultural diversity to strengthen employee perceived organizational support, which in turn enhances affective commitment. Second, the research findings underscore the importance of perceived organizational support in linking cultural diversity management perceptions to organizational outcomes, such as affective commitment. Third, managers should not underestimate the influence of initiatives, such as making all employees feel included in the "taken-for-granted" informal networks in engendering positive organizational and individual attitudes.
   Originality/value - The paper examines cultural diversity management from the employees' (rather than a management) perspective to develop a fully mediated model using organizational support to link cultural diversity management perceptions to commitment. The study reinforces the need to rethink simple relationships between cultural diversity management perceptions and organizational/individual outcomes, to consider more complex models that include important mediating variables to more fully understand the effects of cultural diversity management.

TI Incentives for International Migration of Scientists and Engineers to
   Japan
SO INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Many developed countries, welcome foreign talent, and Japan is no exception. The Japanese government has developed programmes for expanding the acceptance of foreign labour in specialized and technical fields, in order to compete with foreign nations in the global economy and accommodate the highly specialized domestic industrial structure. This paper focuses on scientists and engineers (S&E) as a component of the highly skilled labour force, and examines their incentives for migrating to Japan, which is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. According to a survey conducted in 2004, the majority of S&E working in Japan migrated from Asian nations, and many obtained their doctoral degrees in Japan and continued to stay in the country to work. Key incentives for migration are Japan's high level of science and technology, opportunities to acquire cutting-edge knowledge, and prospects for improving performance in an environment with large budgets, superior equipment and facilities, and good quality human resources. In particular, the technological environment is influential for S&E from countries with a significant technological gap when compared with Japan. However, this does not mean that S&E are indifferent to monetary rewards. The salary gap, which is considered to be a major factor in international mobility in to traditional economic theory, has also proven to be a significant incentive, particularly for S&E from countries where the gap in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared with Japan is large. In addition, cultural and social aspects of Japan attract mainly young S&E. The attractiveness of Japanese culture, opportunities to learn the Japanese language, and chances to build a network of personal contacts are important incentives for migration. This study presents some policy implications for countries competing over capable S&E.

   risk reduction; Pakistan; Kashmir
AB The Chakhama Valley, a remote area in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was badly damaged by the 7.6-magnitude earthquake that struck India and Pakistan on 8 October 2005. More than 5% of the population lost their lives, and about 90% of the existing housing was irreparably damaged or completely destroyed. In early 2006, the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) initiated a multisector, community-driven reconstruction program in the Chakhama Valley on the premise that the scale of the disaster required a response that would address all aspects of people's lives. One important aspect covered the promotion of disaster risk management for sustainable recovery in a safe environment. Accordingly, prevailing hazards (rockfalls, landslides, and debris flow, in addition to earthquake hazards) and existing risks were thoroughly assessed, and the information was incorporated into the main planning processes. Hazard maps, detailed site investigations, and proposals for precautionary measures assisted engineers in supporting the reconstruction of private homes in safe locations to render investments disaster resilient. The information was also used for community-based land use decisions and disaster mitigation and preparedness. The work revealed three main problems: (1) thorough assessment of hazards and incorporation of this assessment into planning processes is time consuming and often little understood by the population directly affected, but it pays off in the long run; (2) relocating people out of dangerous places is a highly sensitive issue that requires the support of clear and forceful government policies; and (3) the involvement of local communities is essential for the success of mitigation and preparedness.

AB Logging has been a much maligned feature of frontier development in the Amazon. Most discussions ignore the fact that logging can be part of a renewable, environmentally benign, and broadly equitable economic activity in these remote places. We estimate there to be some 4.5 +/- A 1.35 billion m(3) of commercial timber volume in the Brazilian Amazon today, of which 1.2 billion m(3) is currently profitable to harvest, with a total potential stumpage value of $15.4 billion. A successful forest sector in the Brazilian Amazon will integrate timber harvesting on private lands and on unprotected and unsettled government lands with timber concessions on public lands. If a legal, productive, timber industry can be established outside of protected areas, it will deliver environmental benefits in synergy with those provided by the region's network of protected areas, the latter of which we estimate to have an opportunity cost from lost timber revenues of $2.3 billion over 30 years. Indeed, on all land accessible to harvesting, the timber industry could produce an average of more than 16 million m(3) per year over a 30-year harvest cycle-entirely outside of current protected areas-providing $4.8 billion in returns to landowners and generating $1.8 billion in sawnwood sales tax revenue. This level of harvest could be profitably complemented with an additional 10% from logging concessions on National Forests. This advance, however, should be realized only through widespread adoption of reduced impact logging techniques.

ID COMPREHENSIVENESS; MATTER
AB Purpose - This paper aims to examine the process and characteristics of strategic decision making (SDM), and their influencing factors in Chinese small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)
   Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted a case study research design It collected data from 20 Chinese SMEs with multiple approaches including interviews with owners/managers, focus groups, gathering of internal documents and access to their web site
   Findings - Several important conclusions can be drawn First, the steps involved in the SDM process in Chinese SMEs are less complex than the theoretical models, second Chinese SME owners/managers rely heavily on their personal networks for identifying opportunities in the business environment and for information search and advice, third, a firm's ownership significantly influences the degree of participation and the level of political activities in the SDM process, and fourth, decisions made in Chinese SMEs can be implemented quickly partly due to slack legal enforcement in China
   Practical implications - For SME owners/managers, a better understanding of the decision making routes provides a basis for enhancing the quality of the decision making process They can expand and/or improve the steps in executing their decision making process For Chinese government policy makers, they can better sponsor training programs in strategic management and develop mentoring programs among SME owners/managers for better connecting them with peers and external advisors For SME researchers this paper has pointed out several important areas for future research
   Origrinality/value - This research is one of the pioneering studies on SDM in Chinese SMEs It provides a detailed description of the SDM process and several important characteristics associated with this process in Chinese SMEs and thus contributed significantly to our understanding and potential improvement of SDM in Chinese SMEs

AB Large-scale computation is frequently limited to the performance of computer hardware or associated cost. However, as the development of information and network technologies thrives, idle computers all over the world can be utilized and organized to enhance overall computation performance; that is, Grid environments that facilitate distributed computation. Hence, the dispatching and scheduling of tasks should be considered as an important issue. Previous studies have demonstrated Grid environments that are composed of idled computers around the globe and are categorized as a type of Heterogeneous Computing (HC). However, scheduling heuristics currently applied to HC focus on the search of minimum makespan, instead of the reduction of cost. In addition, relevant studies usually presume that HC is based on high-speed bandwidth and the communication time is ignored. Further, in response to the call for user-pay policy, as a user dispatches a job to a Grid environment for computation, each execution task would be charged. It is difficult to estimate a job will be dispatched to which and how many computers: it is impossible to predetermine scheduling heuristic which is proposed in previous studies will result in the optimal makespan, and mention actual cost and risk. Therefore, this study proposes ATCS-MCT (Apparent Tardiness Cost Setups-Minimum Completion Time) scheduling algorithm that composes of execution time, weight, due date. and communication time factors to testify that the ATCS-MCT scheduling algorithm not only achieves better makespan than Min-min scheduling heuristics do but also reduces costs.

AB In the past decade it has repeatedly been shown that agriculture is a significant source of ground-and surface water pollution. Nitrogen losses and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are major concerns in agricultural practice and of policy-makers. Rapid intensification of livestock production, a result of the focus on increasing productivity from the 1950s onwards, has contributed to a large increase in nutrient surpluses. Here, we performed a quantitative analysis of the variables influencing the nitrogen use efficiency in Flemish grassland-based farming systems. The analysis was based on the large dataset of the Farm Accountancy Data Network, holding technical and economic data of Flemish farms. A statistical model is proposed by performing multiple regression with several variable selection procedures. Many combinations of variables were studied in 92 models and different criteria were taken into account to select the most adequate combination of variables. This approach focuses on a deep statistical analysis and interpretation of the model. The novelty of this research is the quantification and comparison of the influence of different inputs and other variables in nitrogen use efficiency at the farm level. Our results show that, contrary to current knowledge, a higher nitrogen use efficiency was observed for farms with a higher number of 'Dairy cows ha(-1)', holding the rest of the N inputs constant. A higher stocking density is compatible with a higher agricultural sustainability. It is demonstrated that the amount of milk N produced by added cows is higher than the decrease in milk N produced by each single cow due to a reduced input of feed N per cow. The dairy cow becomes more efficient in the use of N, increasing the farm-gate NUE and the farm sustainability. In the dataset of this study, the variable 'Dairy cows ha(-1)' is more relevant than suggested by previous studies: 1.4 times more relevant than the variable 'kg of N in fertilisers ha(-1)', which is 1.5 times more relevant than 'kg of N in concentrates ha(-1)'. According to previous knowledge, the N input variables present a negative sign. Decreasing the N input in fertilisers, concentrates and by-products are recommended actions to increase the NUE. Unexpected interaction effects were found.

TI Improving WSN Base Station Survivability with Rejuvenation Technology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Wireless sensor network; Survivability; Rejuvenation technology;
   Semi-Markov process
AB The conventional security technology for WSN is mainly focused on improvement to the system's anti-invasion ability; however, seldom concerns how the system should go on providing external services after the invasion and failure, leading to the system's low survivability. In addition, base station is a keyport for WSN. Therefore, software rejuvenation technology is introduced into the construction of a survival model for WSN base station, in order to improve the overall WSN survival performance. The model includes the monitor, the analysis unit, the rejuvenation operation unit, the evaluation unit, strategy Database, etc. Its operation principles are as follows: first, the monitor can gets context information of the system recourses through agents (software sensors), and makes prompt examination and data collecting. Then, the analysis unit will make policy on the collected data, and judge the existence cause and harm degree of abnormal resource consumption by means of knowledge provided by strategies database, in order to perform the rejuvenation operation in time. When the rejuvenation occurs, it is necessary to clear the internal status (e.g., trash recycling, refreshing operation system tables, reinitializing internal data construction etc., adopting different operations in the presence of different strategies), to cut off exterior malicious links, to release system resources, and to restore system performance. Besides, when the rejuvenation operation is performed, the reconfiguration operation can also be adopted in order that patches are put on according to the system loophole, to avoid wrong reappearance caused by system interior drawbacks or the continuous occurrence of the same exterior attacks. Finally, according to the restored system performance, an evaluation of the original strategy which influenced the operation this time should be made and recorded in the strategies database by the evaluation unit, making the frame model adjust itself to a varied environment. Thus, the uninterrupted services can be provided by the system in face of attack or failure by the model, which monitors system performance to predict the rejuvenation interval and performs rejuvenation operation. Otherwise, the model is described by using the Semi-Markov Process and it is discovered that the detection probability of the system compromised state is the key parameter of improving the model's survivability by analyzing the model's stable health state probability. Too convienient for simulation, the base station survival model is described with Stochastic reward network and the experimental results gained by simulation tool SPNP show that the system detection probability is in inverse proportion of the failure probability. According to thought of rejuvenation technology, the failure probability can be reduced significantly by improving system detection probability so as to enhance the survivability of the system, and further improve the overall survival performance of WSN.

TI HABITAT: A longitudinal multilevel study of physical activity change in
   mid-aged adults
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID ECONOMIC COSTS; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; MAINTENANCE; INACTIVITY;
   VARIABLES; EXERCISE; OBESITY
AB Background: Little is known about the patterns and influences of physical activity change in mid-aged adults. This study describes the design, sampling, data collection, and analytical plan of HABITAT, an innovative study of (i) physical activity change over five years (2007-2011) in adults aged 40-65 years at baseline, and (ii) the relative contribution of psychological variables, social support, neighborhood perceptions, area-level factors, and sociodemographic characteristics to physical activity change.
   Methods/Design: HABITAT is a longitudinal multi-level study. 1625 Census Collection Districts (CCDs) in Brisbane, Australia were ranked by their index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage score, categorized into deciles, and 20 CCDs from each decile were selected to provide 200 local areas for study inclusion. From each of the 200 CCDs, dwellings with individuals aged between 40-65 years (in 2007) were identified using electoral roll data, and approximately 85 people per CCD were selected to participate (N = 17,000). A comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) database has been compiled with area-level information on public transport networks, footpaths, topography, traffic volume, street lights, tree coverage, parks, public services, and recreational facilities Participants are mailed a questionnaire every two years (2007, 2009, 2011), with items assessing physical activity (general walking, moderate activity, vigorous activity, walking for transport, cycling for transport, recreational activities), sitting time, perceptions of neighborhood characteristics (traffic, pleasant surroundings, streets, footpaths, crime and safety, distance to recreational and business facilities), social support, social cohesion, activity-related cognitions (attitudes, efficacy, barriers, motivation), health, and sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses will use binary and multinomial logit regression models, as well as generalized linear latent growth models.
   Discussion: HABITAT will provide unique information to improve our understanding of the determinants of physical activity, and to help identify "people" and "place" priority targets for public policy and health promotion aimed at increasing physical activity participation among mid-aged men and women.

AB Now does globalization influence transitions toward more sustainable socio-technical regimes in the developing world? This paper argues that transformations of regimes, the networks and institutions governing technological and environmental practices in an industry, can be positively influenced by globalization but it depends on how global forces interact with local solo-political landscapes-the political-economic institutions, values, and regulations broadly guiding an economy and its relationship to the environment. We evaluate these relationships through a comparison of two kinds of socio-political landscapes-the neo-liberal export-led development model commonly found in the developing world and the uniquely Asian capitalist developmental state. We first show how the neo-liberal model overemphasizes the power of market forces to facilitate upgrading and more sustainable industrialization. We then argue that capitalist developmental states in East and Southeast Asia have been better able to harness global economic forces for technological and sustainability transitions through an openness to trade and investment and effective public-private institutions able to link cleaner technologies and environmental standards to production activities in firms. We buttress this argument with firm-level evidence showing the evolution of socio-technical regimes in two industries-cement and electronics. The case studies demonstrate how interactions with OECD firms can contribute to environmental technique effects provided the socio-political landscape is amenable to changes in an industry's regime. Ultimately, we find the process of transition to be complex and contingent; a hard slog not a leap frog toward a potentially more sustainable future. We close by considering the limitations on the capitalist developmental state model and with comments about what else needs to be learned about globalization's role in sustainability transitions.

AB Background: The public health response to an influenza pandemic or other large-scale health emergency may include mass prophylaxis using multiple points of dispensing (PODs) to deliver countermeasures rapidly to affected populations Computer models created to date to determine "optimal" staffing levels at PODs typically assume stable patient demand for service The authors investigated POD function under dynamic and uncertain operational environments
   Methods: The authors constructed a Monte Carlo simulation model of mass prophylaxis (the Dynamic POD Simulator, or D-PODS) to assess the consequences of nonstationary patient arrival patterns on POD function under a variety of POD layouts and staffing plans Compared are the performance of a standard POD layout under steady-state and variable patient arrival rates that may mimic real-life variation in patient demand
   Results: To achieve similar performance, PODs functioning under nonstationary patient arrival rates require higher staffing levels than would be predicted using the assumption of stationary arrival rates Furthermore, PODs may develop severe bottlenecks unless staffing levels vary over time to meet changing patient arrival patterns. Efficient POD networks therefore require command and control systems capable of dynamically adjusting intra- and inter-POD staff levels to meet demand. In addition, under real-world operating conditions of heightened uncertainty, fewer large PODs will require a smaller total staff than many small PODs to achieve comparable performance
   Conclusions: Modeling environments that capture the effects of fundamental uncertainties in public health disasters are essential for the realistic evaluation of response mechanisms and policies D-PODS quantifies POD operational efficiency under more realistic conditions than have been modeled previously The authors' experiments demonstrate that effective POD staffing plans must be responsive to variation and uncertainty in POD arrival patterns These experiments highlight the need for command and control systems to be created to manage emergency response successfully (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness 2009,3(Suppl 2) S121-S131)

AB Background and Research Objective: The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is particularly high among African American (AA) older adults, and these individuals are least likely to have access to CVD prevention activities. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of People Reducing Risk and Improving Strength through Exercise, Diet and Drug Adherence (PRAISEDD), which is geared at increasing adherence to CVD prevention behaviors among AA and low-income older adults. Methods: This feasibility study was conducted in a senior housing site, using a single-group repeated-measures design and testing physical activity, diet, medication adherence beliefs and behaviors, and blood pressure at baseline and after a 12-week intervention period. Of 22 participants, mean (SD) age was 76.4 (7.6) years, and most were female (64%) and AA (86%). An intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results: There were significant decreases in systolic (P=.02) and diastolic blood pressure (P=.01) and a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in cholesterol intake (P=.09). There were no changes in time spent in moderate-level physical activity, sodium intake, medication adherence, or self-efficacy and outcome expectations across all 3 behaviors. Conclusion: The PRAISEDD intervention was feasible in a group of AA and low-income older adults and, after 12 weeks, resulted in improvements in blood pressure. Future research is needed to test a revised PRAISEDD intervention using a randomized controlled design, a larger sample, and a longer follow-up period. The PRAISEDD intervention should be revised to incorporate environmental and policy changes that influence CVD prevention behaviors and explore the impact of social networking as it relates to diffusion of the intervention among participants in low-income housing facilities.

AB In order to assess agricultural adaptation to climate impacts, new methodologies are needed. The translog distance function allows assessing interactions between different factors, and hence the influence of management on climate impacts. The Farm Accountancy Data Network provides extensive data on farm characteristics of farms throughout the EU15 (i.e. the 15 member states of the European Union before the extension in 2004). These data on farm inputs and outputs from 1990-2003 are coupled with climate data. As climate change is not the only change affecting European agriculture, we also include effects of subsidies and other changes on inputs and outputs of farms throughout Europe. We distinguish several regions and empirically assess (1) climate impacts on farm inputs and outputs in different regions and (2) interactions between inputs and other factors that contribute to the adaptation to these impacts. Changes in production can partly be related to climatic variability and change, but also subsidies and other developments (e. g. technology, markets) are important. Results show that impacts differ per region, and that 'actual impacts' cannot be explicitly separated into 'potential impacts' and 'adaptive capacity' as often proposed for vulnerability assessment. Farmers adapt their practices to prevailing conditions and continuously adapt to changing conditions. Therefore, 'potential impacts' will not be observed in practice, leaving it as a mainly theoretical concept. Factors that contribute to the adaptation also differ per region. In some regions more fertilizers or more irrigation can mitigate impacts, while in other regions this amplifies impacts. To project impacts of future climate change on agriculture, current farm management strategies and their influence on current production should be considered. This clearly asks for improved integration of biophysical and economic models.

AB Chia-Ying Ko, Ruey-Shing Lin, Tzung-Su Ding, Chih-Hao Hsieh, and Pei-Fen Lee (2009) Identifying biodiversity hotspots by predictive models: a case study using Taiwan's endemic bird species. Zoological Studies 48(3): 418-431. Predicting species distributions and identifying biodiversity hotspots are essential in designing conservation strategies. Because of different spatial scales and/or species characteristics, uncertainty still exist as to which model is the best. Several models have been proposed to calculate the probability of species occurrences, predict biodiversity hotspots, and decide importance levels of those hotspots. We constructed predictive distribution models for 14 of 16 endemic bird species in Taiwan using a fine-resolution (1 x 1 km) breeding bird distribution dataset compiled over the past decade as well as environmental variables. We compared the performances of the 4 models: logistic regression (I-R), multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP), and artificial neural network (ANN). Maps for biodiversity hotspots were generated based on the species distributions from the 4 models. To account for potential uncertainty, we constructed hotspot maps using a frequency histogram and probability density function approaches. Based on the distribution maps and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, all of our models made good predictions for each species (all AUC values were > 0.75). The nonlinear models (GARP, ANN, and LR) provided better predictions than did the linear (MDA) model. GARP was the most consistent model when evaluated by it kappa, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity values for each species and the 3 species categories (common, uncommon, and rare species). The prevalence of all species did not affect the final predictive performance. The 5 biodiversity hotspot maps derived from the frequency histogram approach showed a relatively similar pattern to maps generated by the probability density function, which indicated that of mid- to high-elevation areas had higher probabilities. In spite of some inconsistencies, the hotspot maps identified from these 2 approaches were fairly representative when evaluated against currently known hotspots. A GAP analysis indicated only 25% of the hotspots are currently protected by national parks. We concluded that the LR, GARP, ANN, and MIDA models are all feasible to use for modeling bird species distributions. Although there were some limitations, we suggest using a combination approach to identify common features and conservation priorities of biodiversity hotspots. Comparing known and predicted hotspots can promote the reliability of the models as well as provide managers with greater confidence when planning conservation policies. Finally, this approach to identifying common features and conservation priorities of biodiversity hotspots can be applied to evaluate conservation efforts and provide a better tool to achieve efficient conservation. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.3/418.pdf

AB Background: This exploratory paper outlines an epidemic simulator built on an agent-based, data-driven model of the spread of a disease within an urban environment. An intent of the model is to provide insight into how a disease may reach a tipping point, spreading to an epidemic of uncontrollable proportions.
   Methods: As a complement to analytical methods, simulation is arguably an effective means of gaining a better understanding of system-level disease dynamics within a population and offers greater utility in its modeling capabilities. Our investigation is based on this conjecture, supported by data-driven models that are reasonable, realistic and practical, in an attempt to demonstrate their efficacy in studying system-wide epidemic phenomena. An agent-based model (ABM) offers considerable flexibility in extending the study of the phenomena before, during and after an outbreak or catastrophe.
   Results: An agent-based model was developed based on a paradigm of a 'discrete-space scheduled walker' (DSSW), modeling a medium-sized North American City of 650,000 discrete agents, built upon a conceptual framework of statistical reasoning (law of large numbers, statistical mechanics) as well as a correct-by-construction bias. The model addresses where, who, when and what elements, corresponding to network topography and agent characteristics, behaviours, and interactions upon that topography. The DSSW-ABM has an interface and associated scripts that allow for a variety of what-if scenarios modeling disease spread throughout the population, and for data to be collected and displayed via a web browser.
   Conclusion: This exploratory paper also presents several research opportunities for exploiting data sources of a non-obvious and disparate nature for the purposes of epidemic modeling. There is an increasing amount and variety of data that will continue to contribute to the accuracy of agent-based models and improve their utility in modeling disease spread. The model developed here is well suited to diseases where there is not a predisposition for contraction within the population. One of the advantages of agent-based modeling is the ability to set up a rare event and develop policy as to how one may mitigate damages arising from it.

TI What promotes sustainability in Safe Community programmes?

DT Article
ID INJURY PREVENTION PROGRAM
AB Background: The theory and practice of safety promotion has traditionally focused on the safety of individuals. This study also includes systems, environments, and organizations. Safety promotion programmes are designed to support community health initiatives taking a bottom-up approach. This is a long-term and complex process. The aim of this study was to try to empirically identify factors that promote sustainability in the structures of programmes that are managed and coordinated by the local government.
   Methods: Four focus group sessions with local government politicians and administrators in designated Safe Communities were conducted and analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Collaboration was found to be the basis for sustainability. Networks, enabling municipalities to exchange ideas, were reported to positively influence the programmes. Personal contacts rather than organizations themselves, determine whether collaboration is sustained. Participants reported an increase in cross-disciplinary collaboration among staff categories. Administrators and politicians were reported to collaborate well, which was perceived to speed up decision-making and thus to facilitate the programme work. Support from the politicians and the county council was seen as a prerequisite. Participants reported an increased willingness to share information between units, which, in their view, supports sustainability. A structure in which all local authorities' offices were located in close proximity to one another was considered to support collaboration. Appointing a public health coordinator responsible for the programme was seen as a way to strengthen the relational resources of the programme.
   Conclusion: With a public health coordinator, the 'external' negotiating power was concentrated in one person. Also, the 'internal' programme strength increased when the coordination was based on a bureaucratic function rather than on one individual. Increased relational resources facilitated the transfer of information. A regular flow of information to policy-makers, residents, and staff was needed in order to integrate safety programmes into routines. Adopting a bottom-up approach requires that informal and ad hoc activities in information management be replaced by formalized, organizationally sanctioned routines. In contrast to injury prevention, which focuses on technical solutions, safety promotion tries to influence attitudes. Collaboration with the media was an area that could be improved.

ID SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; OBESITY
AB Background: Overweight/obesity increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from a number of chronic conditions, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers. This study examined the distribution of body mass index (BMI) in nine Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites in five Asian countries and investigated the association between social factors and overweight.
   Data and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in nine HDSS sites in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. The methodology of the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance with core risk factors (Step 1) and physical measurements for weight, height and waist circumference (Step 2) were included. In each site, about 2,000 men and women aged 25-64 years were selected randomly using the HDSS database. Weight was measured using electronic scales, height was measured by portable stadiometers and waist circumference was measured by measuring tape. Overweight/obesity was assessed by BMI defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/m(2)).
   Results: At least 10% people were overweight (BMI >= 25) in each site except for the two sites in Vietnam and WATCH HDSS in Bangladesh where few men and women were overweight. After controlling for all the variables in the model, overweight increases with age initially and then declines, with increasing education, and with gender with women being heavier than men. People who eat vegetables and fruits below the recommended level and those who do high level of physical activity are, on the whole, less heavy than those who eat more and do less physical activity.
   Conclusions: As the proportion of the population classified as being overweight is likely to increase in most sites and overweight varies by age, sex, and social and behavioural factors, behavioural interventions (physical exercise, healthy diet) should be developed for the whole population together with attention to policy around nutrition and the environment, in order to reduce the adverse effects of overweight on health.

AB Aim
   Eurycorymbus cavaleriei (Levl.) Rehd. et Hand.-Mazz. (Sapindaceae) is a Tertiary relict tree endemic to subtropical China. This area is a centre for speciation and evolution within the East Asia biome and one of its most important refugial locations. In this study we aim to elucidate the phylogeographical patterning in E. cavaleriei, in order to identify the locations of the species' main refugia and the predominant patterns of migration that have led to the contemporary spatial genetic structure of chloroplast variation.
   Location
   Subtropical China.
   Methods
   We sampled 18 populations of E. cavaleriei throughout its geographical range. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence data from two non-coding regions ((trnS/trnG and pl20/5'-rps12) were obtained from 170 individuals for phylogeographical analyses. Relationships among cpDNA haplotypes were determined using median-joining networks. Genetic structure was examined by spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). Population differentiation was estimated by G(ST) and N-ST statistics.
   Results
   Ten distinct haplotypes were identified. The level of differentiation among populations was relatively high (G(ST) = 0.817), and N-ST was significantly higher than G(ST) (P < 0.05), indicating that strong phylogeographical structure is exhibited by this species. The SAMOVA revealed five diverging groups of related haplotypes, which coincide with major landscape features in this region.
   Main conclusions
   The high differentiation among populations of E. cavaleriei may be a combined effect of historical and contemporary processes, such as the low effective population size for the chloroplast genome of a dioecious species, long-term range fragmentation and limited seed dispersal for the species. Clear-cut geographical distributions of ancestral haplotypes of the species suggest multiple potential refugia across subtropical China. The identified refugial regions have long been recognized as centres of plant diversity and endemism for China and have also been suggested as glacial refugia for many other plant species. The combination of these factors means that these locations should be considered as the highest priority for inclusion in conservation policies and sustainable forest management strategies for subtropical China.

AB Anomaly-based intrusion detection is about the discrimination of malicious and legitimate behaviors on the basis of the characterization of system normality in terms of particular observable subjects. As the system normality is constructed solely from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns, anomaly detectors always suffer excessive false alerts. Adaptability is therefore a desirable feature that enables an anomaly detector to alleviate, if not eliminate, such annoyance. To achieve that, we either design self-learning anomaly detectors to capture the drifts of system normality or develop postprocessing mechanisms to deal with the outputs. As the former methodology is usually scenario-and application-specific, in this article, we focus on the latter one. In particular, our design starts from three key observations: (1) most of anomaly detectors are threshold based and parametric, that is, configurable by a set of parameters; (2) anomaly detectors differ in operational environment and operational capability in terms of detection coverage and blind spots; (3) an intrusive anomaly may leave traces across multiple system layers, incurring different observable events of interest. Firstly, we present a statistical framework to formally characterize and analyze the basic behaviors of anomaly detectors by examining the properties of their operational environments. The framework then serves as a theoretical basis for developing an adaptive middleware, which is called M-AID, to optimally integrate a number of observation-specific parameterizable anomaly detectors. Specifically, M-AID treats these fine-grained anomaly detectors as a whole and casts their collective behaviors in a framework which is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MPO-MDP). The generic anomaly detection models of M-AID are thus automatically inferred via a reinforcement learning algorithm which dynamically adjusts the behaviors of anomaly detectors in accordance with a reward signal that is defined and quantified by a suit of evaluation metrics. Fundamentally, the distributed and autonomous architecture enables M-AID to be scalable, dependable, and adaptable, and the reward signal allows security administrators to specify cost factors and take into account the operational context for taking rational response. Finally, a host-based prototype of M-AID is developed, along with comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative studies.

AB In the United Kingdom, as with other European countries, land-based emissions of NO(x) and SO(2) have fallen significantly over the last few decades. SO(2) emissions fell from a peak of 3185 Gg Sin 1970 to 344 Gg Sin 2005 and are forecast by business-as-usual emissions scenarios to fall to 172 Gg by 2020. NO(x) emissions were at a maximum of 951 Gg N in 1970 and fell to 378 by 2005 with a further decrease to 243 Gg N forecast by 2020. These large changes in emissions have not been matched by emissions changes for NH(3) which decreased from 315 Gg N in 1990 to 259 in 2005 and are forecast to fall to 222 by 2020. The Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange model (FRAME) has been applied to model the spatial distribution of sulphur and nitrogen deposition over the United Kingdom during a 15-year time period (1990-2005) and compared with measured deposition of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium from the national monitoring network. Wet deposition of nitrogen and sulphur was found to decrease more slowly than the emissions reductions rate. This is attributed to a number of factors including increases in emissions from international shipping and changing rates of atmospheric oxidation. The modelled time series was extended to a 50-year period from 1970 to 2020. The modelled deposition of SO(x), NO(y) and NH(x) to the UK was found to fall by 87%, 52% and 25% during this period. The percentage area of sensitive habitats in the United Kingdom for which critical loads are exceeded is estimated to fall from 85% in 1970 to 37% in 2020 for acidic deposition and from 73% to 49% for nutrient nitrogen deposition. The significant reduction in land emissions of SO(2) and NO(x) focuses further attention in controlling emissions from international shipping. Future policies to control emissions of ammonia from agriculture will be required to effect further significant reductions in nitrogen deposition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a result of diverse management policies, densities of red and roe deer have varied considerably for the last few decades in Europe. Their selective browsing on woody species can modify the interactions between competing species and thus change overall patterns of plant diversity in forests. However, no classification of woody species according to browsing by deer yet exists in Europe. The selectivity index, which measures the balance between availability and consumption of plant species by herbivores, could be used for such a classification. The aim of this study was, first, to rank woody species according to this selectivity index, then to test whether their rank changed when browsing pressure varied in space or time. We also explored morphological and ecological life traits (Ellenberg indicator values) that might explain differences in selectivity.
   In 2006, we re-sampled a network of 217 coupled floristic and browsing survey plots, which had been previously described twice (1976,1981). The plots were located in the forest of Arc-en-Barrois (France), a large woodland area divided into a North and a South Forest which have had different histories of browsing pressure.
   For the three samples and the two forests, we calculated a selectivity index for 19 woody species. Dogwood (Corpus sp.) and field rose (Rosa arvensis) appeared to be the most selected species whereas beech (Fagus sylvatica), common mezereon (Daphne mezereum) and wild-service tree (Sorbus torminalis) were always avoided. The rank order of species according to their selectivity index remained stable over the three sample years and between the two forests (Spearman's rank correlations: rho approximate to 0.8 spatially, and range from 0.3 to 0.8 temporally). This indicates that variations in browsing pressure did not strongly modify deer selectivity patterns. Selectivity was positively correlated with wood density and negatively correlated with maximum height of the species, but unrelated to other plant traits. Finally, selectivity can be seen as an intrinsic characteristic of those woody species, and could be used as an additional life trait when analyzing vegetation communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Introduction: The nursing literature includes descriptions of rural nursing workforces in Canada, the United States of America and Australia. However, inconsistent definitions of rural demography, diverse employment conditions and health care system reorganization make comparisons of these data difficult. In 2007, the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care in Ontario, Canada, transferred responsibility for decision-making and funding to 14 regional governing bodies known as Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). Little is known about rural-urban variations in the nursing workforces in the LHINs because existing data repositories do not describe them. This study investigated the influence of demographic characteristics, provincial policies, organizational changes and emerging practice challenges on nursing work in a geographically unique rural region. The purpose was to describe the nature of nursing work from the perspective of rural nurse executives and frontline nurses. The study was conducted in 7 small rural and community hospitals in the Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant LHIN.
   Methods: Data collection occurred between August and November 2007. A qualitative descriptive study design was chosen to facilitate exploration of nursing in the rural setting. Study participants were identified through purposive snowball sampling. All nurses, nurse managers and nurse executives currently employed in the 7 study hospitals were eligible to participate. Data collection included the use of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Memos were also created to describe the relevance and applicability of concepts, categories and properties emerging from the data. Themes were compared across interviews to determine relevance and value.
   Results: Twenty-one nurses from 7 different hospitals participated. The nurses reflect the aging trend in the provincial and regional workforces of Ontario. All study participants anticipate a substantial increase in retirements during the next decade, which will alter the structure and capacity of the rural workforce. Rural nursing practice is generalist in nature, requiring personal flexibility and a broad knowledge base. The nurses in the study preferred this type of practice. However, they felt that new nurses have different values and goals and are more likely to choose the specialized practice opportunities available in urban tertiary centres. Structural changes to the health system influenced relationships between hospitals and altered the internal organization of individual hospitals. Nurse executives were positive about new opportunities for cost savings, sharing best practices and continuing education. Yet they also felt that organizational changes significantly increased their administrative responsibilities and limited their opportunities for communication with frontline nurses. The nurses thought that the changing organizational structures increased opportunities to seek multiple employers to augment the lack of full-time positions in the region. Many reported that part-time and casual nurses often seek employment in other hospitals and long-term care homes to supplement their income. However, multi-site employment within and across healthcare organizations contributes to scheduling issues because casual nurses are unavailable to fill vacant shifts. Patient transports, the implementation of e-technology and emerging disease patterns in the patient population were identified as additional practice challenges.
   Conclusion: This study has implications for health human resource planning in rural and small community hospitals. The findings indicate that demographic trends pose an immediate threat to the sustainability of the nursing workforce in the rural setting. Many nurses are nearing retirement, but the lack of opportunities for full-time positions as well as specialized and expanded nursing practice are attracting younger nurses to urban centres. Government policies focussing on the retention of clinical expertise, the recruitment of new graduates and expanding the role of registered practical nurses have been more difficult to implement in the rural setting. Implications for future research include the need to address data gaps to facilitate workforce planning and to evaluate the effectiveness of provincial recruitment and retention strategies in the rural context.

AB The main objective of the COST 296 Action "Mitigation of Ionospheric Effects on Radio Systems" is the establishment/improvement of ionospheric services by coordinating the development of specific algorithms. models, and tools capable of operating in a near-real-time mode.
   Key elements of these activities are contributions related to monitoring, modelling, and imaging of customer-relevant ionospheric quantities. COST stimulates, coordinates, and Supports Europe's goals of development and global cooperation by providing high quality information and knowledge of ionospheric and plasmaspheric conditions enabling high quality and reliable operation of radio systems.
   It also provides a platform for sharing such tools as algorithms or models, and for the joint development of advanced technologies. It takes advantage of many national and European service initiatives, for example DIAS (http://dias.space.noa.gr), SWACI (http://w3swaci.dlr.de), ESWUA (http://www.eswua.ingv.it/ingv), RWC-Warsaw (http://www.cbk.waw.pl/rwc), the COST Prompt Ionospheric Database http://www.wdc.rl.ac.uk/cgibin/digisondes/cost_database.pl, http://www.izmiran.ru/services, and others.
   Existing national capabilities are taken into account to develop synergies and avoid duplication. The enhancement of environment monitoring networks and associated instrumentation yields Mutual advantages for European and regional services specialized for local user needs.
   It structurally increases the integration of limited-area services, and generates a platform employing the same approach to each task differing mostly in input and output data. In doing so it also provides a complementary description of the environmental state within issued information, as well as providing a platform for interaction among local end users, who define what kind of information they need, for system providers, who Finalize the tools necessary to obtain required information, and for local service providers, who do the actual processing of data, tailoring it to specific users' needs. Such an initiative creates a unique opportunity for small national services to consolidate their product design so that is no longer limited to their own activity, but Can serve the wider European services.
   The development and improvement of techniques for mitigating ionospheric effects on radio systems by the COST 296 Action prepared those services that implemented the new design techniques for the newly announced EU and ESA policy-Space Situation Awareness (SSA). COST 296 developments applied to nowcasting and forecasting services are an essential input to the Operational SSA Ionosphere.

AB Background/Context: The sustainability of change efforts continues to be an important and challenging question in educational research.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: By examining 13 programs aimed at increasing student voice in school reform, this article examines conditions that enable and constrain the sustainability of this challenging form of educational change.
   Population/Participants/Subjects: The 13 high schools in this study all received grant funding from a local foundation in the San Francisco Bay Area to work on building a student voice initiative in their school. All the grant recipients and their schools in the sample were situated within an urban environment, either within an inner city or a bedroom community in the Bay Area that possessed urban characteristics of the region. These characteristics include an ethnically diverse population comprising students of Asian, Latin, African, and European descent, insufficiently funded public schools, and high concentrations of poverty.
   Intervention/Program/Practice: When placed into practice, student voice initiatives provide youth with opportunities to participate in school decision-making that will shape their lives and the lives of their peers. Student voice can range from the most basic level of youth sharing their opinions of problems and potential solutions, to allowing young people to collaborate with adults to address the problems in their schools, to youth taking the lead on seeking change.
   Research Design: This study consists of a multiple case study designed for the purpose of explanation building.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Semistructured telephone interviews served as the primary data source for this article. Observations, documents, and external evaluations served as validity checks and sources of triangulation for this study.
   Findings/Results: The data indicate that the persistence of a student-voice effort after the initial influx of funds and support disappeared requires support from an intermediary organization (IO)-an organization located outside the auspices of school walls. IOs can help with fostering a clear and long-term vision, providing a more stable source of leadership, identifying ongoing financial and collaborative resources, and building a network for knowledge generation and sharing.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Although they are a part of many reform initiatives, partnerships with IOs are usually considered to be short-term relationships during the implementation phase of an initiative. This research instead suggests that IOs might be better suited as long-term partners in many change efforts. An awareness of the important roles that IOs can play in the long-term work toward change could help researchers, practitioners, and policy makers think more intentionally about how to plan for stabilizing such partnerships as an avenue toward sustaining reform initiatives.

AB As part of the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP; < a href='http://www.htap.org' target='_blank'> http:// www.htap.org </a >) project, we analyze results from 15 global and 1 hemispheric chemical transport models and compare these to Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) observations in the United States (US) for 2001. Using the policy-relevant maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8 O-3) statistic, the multi-model ensemble represents the observations well (mean r(2)=0.57, ensemble bias = +4.1 ppbv for all US regions and all seasons) despite a wide range in the individual model results. Correlations are strongest in the northeastern US during spring and fall (r(2)=0.68); and weakest in the midwestern US in summer (r(2)=0.46). However, large positive mean biases exist during summer for all eastern US regions, ranging from 10-20 ppbv, and a smaller negative bias is present in the western US during spring (similar to 3 ppbv). In nearly all other regions and seasons, the biases of the model ensemble simulations are < 5 ppbv. Sensitivity simulations in which anthropogenic O-3-precursor emissions (NOx + NMVOC + CO + aerosols) were decreased by 20% in four source regions: East Asia (EA), South Asia (SA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA) show that the greatest response of MDA8 O-3 to the summed foreign emissions reductions occurs during spring in the West (0.9 ppbv reduction due to 20% emissions reductions from EA + SA + EU). East Asia is the largest contributor to MDA8 O-3 at all ranges of the O-3 distribution for most regions (typically similar to 0.45 ppbv) followed closely by Europe. The exception is in the northeastern US where emissions reductions in EU had a slightly greater influence than EA emissions, particularly in the middle of the MDA8 O-3 distribution (response of similar to 0.35 ppbv between 35-55 ppbv). EA and EU influences are both far greater (about 4x) than that from SA in all regions and seasons. In all regions and seasons O-3-precursor emissions reductions of 20% in the NA source region decrease MDA8 O-3 the most - by a factor of 2 to nearly 10 relative to foreign emissions reductions. The O-3 response to anthropogenic NA emissions is greatest in the eastern US during summer at the high end of the O-3 distribution (5-6 ppbv for 20% reductions). While the impact of foreign emissions on surface O-3 in the US is not negligible - and is of increasing concern given the recent growth in Asian emissions - domestic emissions reductions remain a far more effective means of decreasing MDA8 O-3 values, particularly those above 75 ppb (the current US standard).

TI INTERPRETATIONS OF THE "INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETY, AND NATION" WITHIN THE
   IDEOLOGY OF POLITICAL CATHOLICISM IN SLOVENIA

AB The paper deals with the ideologists of Slovene political Catholicism during the inter-war period, viewed as the bearers of the idea of Slovene society and Slovene nation. Their specific role is that of creators or 'architects of society' that - in a totalitarian manner - extended from prescribing the spirituality of each individual to interpreting the only 'correct' Slovene history politics, and culture.
   In Slovenia the 1930s tragicomic restoration of the Ancien regime in a provincial-corporate form followed the model of the Austrian provincial-corporate state and the ideology of the European catholic right yet bearing a singular national character and context. Its development, conditioned by the application of patterns and influences from the Austro-Hungarian and broader German spaces ill the Slovene environment, can be followed from the end of the 19(th) century through World War II.
   The application of European influences is characterized by the interpretation of contemporary social phenomena and trends as well as 'modernity' in general through a series of ideological strategies adopted by the ideologists of Slovene political Catholicism to define (through interpretations of modernity) the social role of each individual, his taste (from art to food), how many electoral votes each individual should have, what he should wear, etc.
   These and similar issues that front a contemporary perspective may be reminiscent of philosophical deliberation in an ivory tower in fact were directly injected into the society through the pedagogical process and a wide network of political and religious organizations; finally, they penetrated the editorial policies, the question of limited enrolment in schools, the search for employment, and the right to publication.
   The 1930s ideologists of Slovene political Catholicism cannot simply be perceived as theoretical "Ideologieliferants" that had little or nothing to do with social practice. In fact, people like Ales Usenicnik were decision-makers in relation to a series of fundamental questions, and consciously took over the application of ideology to social practice. In an organicist manner they would engage in continuous interpretations of the application of modernity onto the individual, society, and nation. From the organizational perspective of the interpretation of 'reality', political Catholicism used three fundamental groups of intellectuals: a) members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy (from the diocese to the parish), b) ideology creators (theologians, catholic sociologists - usually priests), c) catholic politicians (usually priests with a direct political application).
   The direct competitors and thus defined adversaries of the ideologists of Slovene political Catholicism in interpretations of modernity (following the principle "He who is not with us is against us.") were: lay politicians (liberals, social democrats), lay intellectuals (politicians and men of letters), dissidents within the catholic circles (Christian socialists, personalists, etc.), non-catholic writers (in particular in interpretations of literature and history editors of lay media (lay press and public opinion), foreign (European) authors (ideas from the broader European space), teachers (lay education), editors (theatre, radio, film). At the end the ideological sieve of political Catholicism resorted to censorship, and thus elements that were supposed to finally constitute the 'correct' vision and project of Slovene society and nation were interpreted as the only acceptable facts.

TI Multivariable Value Densification Modeling Using GIS
SO TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
LA English
DT Article
AB A team of researchers comprised of architects, urbanists, planners and civil engineers from Lawrence Technological University and the University of Detroit Mercy developed a value densification tool used primarily to evaluate density of resources and physical features within Southwest Detroit, Michigan. This community is a diverse and vibrant neighborhood that is currently transforming socially, physically and economically. This project - the Value Densification Community Mapping Project (VDCmp) - was developed to explore how aspects of the post-industrial city can be understood, communicated and leveraged in service of equity and sustainability and to use technology to reveal data about the city in order to convince community, political and economic leadership to embrace a broader interpretation of value. Building on an asset-based, community empowerment planning model, the research team is collaborating to create a unique "free-ware" GIS incorporating and merging components of Google Earth, Sketch Up and ERSI ArcGIS to model physical and social density and value in three dimensions. The resultant digital interface empowers the community through asset identification and creation of an accessible tool to assist in envisioning its environmental, social and economic future. The VDCmp digital interface is unique in that it models "social exchanges" in three dimensions and allows the user to overlay social and infrastructure layers with physical density. With funding from the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), the VDCmp and research team is engaging nonprofit groups in Southwest Detroit to determine how they can best utilize data and mapping in planning, design, development and evaluative tools. The focus of this work has been on creating a comprehensive tool that can support community design and development policy decisions. Community members have become active partners in evolving the digital interface as a tool for strategic planning at the agency/organization, coalition, city and regional levels. The active community members have either provided to the research team the self-generated data found to be significant to them (the stakeholders) or requested certain publicly available data sets to be incorporated in the interface. Significant geoprocessing using ArcGIS was used on these data sets (of various formats) in order to pre-process and evaluate the data for accuracy and quality assurance. These data were then exported to keyhole markup language (kml) or keyhole markup zip (kmz) files and the visualization of these data were developed in Google Earth, which included significant polygon and polyline extrusion (used to display multivariable attributes for single features). Sketch Up models were also used to display density of historic sites, green infrastructure, parking and other features. The team will also incorporate three dimensional network diagrams in GIS to display the interactions and relationships that residential households have with religious, cultural and commercial assets, among others. These techniques have allowed the community groups to visually identify over-or under-served resources, conflicting planning objectives, environmental health impacts, or areas of social inequality, with an end-goal of developing a dynamic, unified development and preservation strategy for the community. The VDCmp has evolved from a pilot project to an ever expanding collaborative initiative featuring multiple institutions, clients, stakeholders and geographies.
   The VDCmp has a triprtite nature. It is at once a Research Initiative; a Tool; and a Community Process, each requiring very different approaches to collaboration, deliverables and dissemination. Now developed, this framework may be replicated in other Detroit neighborhoods or across the region or country to further advance the concepts of Value Densification mapping.
