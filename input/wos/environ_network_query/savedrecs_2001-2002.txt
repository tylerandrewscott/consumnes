AB Transnational networking has come to the fore as a strategy for coping with the increasingly stringent fiscal climate in which European municipalities have had to operate in the last two to three decades. New funding streams for policy development and implementation have emerged with the Commission's financing of trans-European local authority networks. In this paper we consider the formation of a shared European identity and the nature and content of interauthority networking activities, drawing upon the example of one newly formed network - the edge cities network. Here we make use of original empirical material drawn from three case-study edge city municipalities - Croydon, Getafe and Noisy-le-Grand. We find that a weak form of shared European edge urban identity has developed to date, and that the direct and indirect benefits of networking are not all that they might be. There is some evidence that longstanding national traditions of interorganizational working and administrative arrangements have exerted an influence on the networking activities of at least one of these edge urban municipalities. In this respect, transnational networking meshes with aspects of local entrepreneurial coalition building which are often imbued with a sense of interlocality competition for private and public investment.

SO GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY; EVOLUTION; NETWORKS; WORLD
AB In recent years, transnational and domestic nongovernmental organizations have created non-state market-driven (NSMD) governance systems whose purpose is to develop and implement environmentally and socially responsible management practices. Eschewing traditional state authority, these systems and their supporters have turned to the market's supply chain to create incentives and force companies to comply.
   This paper develops an analytical framework designed to understand better the emergence of NSMD governance systems and the conditions under which they may gain authority to create policy. Its theoretical roots draw on pragmatic, moral, and cognitive legitimacy granting distinctions made within organizational sociology, while its empirical focus is on the case of sustainable forestry certification, arguably the most advanced case of NSMD governance globally. The paper argues that such a framework is needed to assess whether these new private governance systems might ultimately challenge existing state-centered authority and public policy-making processes, and in so doing reshape power relations within domestic and global environmental governance.

AB The emergence of environmental governance for sustainable development as a field of inquiry has stimulated a plethora of research into new formations for governing the environment. Partnerships hold an exalted status in these formations, but there has been surprisingly little evaluative work of their activities. This paper extends that embryonic analysis through empirical consideration of a partnership established to foster the development of sustainable communities, specifically by stimulating greater public participation in positive environmental activities. Theoretical insights about patterns of power, perceived authority and legitimacy in the partnership are developed through a consideration of 'actor-spaces' and the 'sociology of translation' that emerge from actor-network theory.

AB The transformation of planning across Europe in recent years has been characterized by new processes at different spatial scales that reach across traditional boundaries. This Europeanization of planning processes is reflected in the emergence of cross-border initiatives, new spatial relationships and the enhancement of regional policy-making. In using the case of the UK this article analyses the possible ramifications of adopting the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). It is demonstrated that the WFD, despite its apparent focus on water regulation, is symptomatic of wider European Spatial Planning processes that are seeing a reshaping of attitudes, witnessing the emergence of new networks and challenging traditional sovereignties of planning.

AB The identification of the major information technology (IT) access control policies is required to direct "best practice" approaches within the IT security program of an organisation. In demonstrating the need for security access control policies in the IT security program, it highlights the significant shift away from centralised mainframes towards distributed networked computing environments. The study showed that the traditional and proven security control mechanisms used in the mainframe environments were not applicable to distributed systems, and as a result, a number of inherent risks were identified with the new technologies.
   Because of the critical nature of the information assets of organisations, then appropriate risk management strategies should be afforded through access control policies to the IT systems. The changing technology has rendered mainframe centralised security solutions as ineffective in providing controls on distributed network systems
   This investigation revealed that the need for policies for access control of an information system from corporate governance guidelines and risk management strategies were required to protect information assets of an organisation. The paper proposes a high level approach to implementing security policies through information security responsibilities, management accountability policy, and other baseline access control security policies individual and distributed systems.

TI Virus-crisis-institutional change: The foot and mouth actor network and
   the governance of rural affairs in the UK
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper adopts an actor-network theory approach in order to follow the associations of actors involved in the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK. We follow the chains of translation through three key stages: from virus to disease; from disease to crises in agriculture, the rural economy and rural policy, and from those crises to the institutional change that occurred with the demise of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the arrival of the new Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs. What emerges from this approach is that the UK Government's initial attempts to combat FMD caused a rural economy crisis not through mismanagement but through a more fundamental mis-problematization of the situation. By viewing rural areas through an agricultural lens, Government actors failed to appreciate the presence of other actors in the countryside, a failure that resulted in massive social and economic impacts outside of the agricultural sector.

TI Energy policy: security of supply, sustainability and competition
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper considers the main components of energy policy, in particular the challenges of network security of supply, long-term contracts and the environmental constraints. It is argued that policy should take account of multiple market failures and context dependent. Given energy liberalisation in the 1980s and 1990s, interventions based upon market-based instruments should be given greater prominence. Institutional reform to reflect the shift in focus towards investment in non-carbon technologies and the security issues associated with networks is proposed, notably the creation of an energy agency.

AB The aim of the paper is to examine the governmentalities associated with attempts to manage nature. In particular, it assesses the role that numbers have played in rural governance. Numbers are seen as an important tool of modern government. However, like other aspects of science, their use in governing nature has been contested by other epistemologies. Drawing upon efforts to regulate the spread of bovine tuberculosis in cattle, the paper firstly examines how numbers have been used in this policy debate. Secondly, the paper outlines three epistemologies of nature - nature as numbers, nature as known and ecological nature - which have been employed in contesting government policy. Finally the paper concludes by analysing the interactions of these knowledges of nature and considering the voice of the badger in these constructions of its identity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Coffee is a truly global commodity and a major foreign exchange earner in many developing countries. The global coffee chain has changed dramatically as a result of deregulation, new consumption patterns, and evolving corporate strategies. From a balanced contest between producing and consuming countries within the politics of international coffee agreements, power relations shifted to the advantage of transnational corporations. A relatively stable institutional environment where proportions of generated income were fairly distributed between producing and consuming countries turned into one that is more informal. unstable. and unequal. Through the lenses of global commodity chain analysis, this paper examines how these transformations affect developing countries and what policy instruments are available to address the emerging imbalances.

AB European policy for the protection of the environment, and specially with regard to the problem of limiting the effects of eutrophication of rivers and coastal ecosystems from different types of pollution sources such as (a) agriculture and land use, (b) point source emissions, i.e. industrial waste and sewage discharge from urban areas and (c) atmospheric deposition, is carried out through the application of a range of EU Water Directives. The JRC in collaboration with DG XI and EEA are initiating a programme to identify and develop a network of small river basins-coastal zones across a range of European climatic conditions (Norwegian Sea, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Seas) and investigate methodologies for assessing the efficiency of the application of selected Water Directives in terms of water quality and socio-economic cost-benefit.

AB The object of this paper is to investigate the sustainability of water use in human settlements. The water system of a small municipality in northern Italy is discussed as a case study. By measuring water exchanges between different sectors of activity within the municipal borders, and considering underground and surface waters as natural components of this system, a network of flows is built and successively investigated by network analysis, a tool that is comprised in the apparatus of ecosystem ecology. By calculating the reciprocal dependence of compartments, the amount of resource that is involved in cycling, the length of exchange pathways, and the organization of flows, network analysis shows that the system does not use water in a sustainable manner and provides general criteria for improving sustainability. In this respect, options to improve sustainability are also discussed. The results of this study support the idea that the ecosystem approach can provide an interesting conceptual perspective in which sustainability issues can be framed, and that network analysis is a promising tool to handle these issues in practice.

AB The implementation of the EU habitats directive 92/43/EEC and the creation of the coherent network 'Natura 2000', presumably the most ambitious supranational initiative for nature conservation world-wide, is facing increasing difficulties. The process has been delayed beyond hope for the initial time-frame of an existing network being met by the year 2004. Political will and acceptance amongst national administrations and rural population is lacking. In the highly complex political structure of the European Union, presently in a stage of rapid change and development, new forms of political influence have evolved for non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This study, using social research methods (problem-focussed interviews and literature studies), examines the aims, strategies and activities of the involved political actors, and illustrates the shifting political influence of NGOs over the past 10 years with regards to the development and implementation of the directive. In the theoretical framework of multi-level governance, the political influence of the forest owner associations CEPF and BNFF, as well as the environmental NGOs WWF and Fern, together with other involved actors on the development and the implementation process of the EU habitats directive (HD) is described. Drawing on the advocacy coalition framework (ACF) approach of Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith, a strategic alliance between the Directorate General (DG) Environment and the WWF with the common goal of successfully establishing Natura 2000 can be ascertained. This coalition, however, was found to be opposed in the political subsystem of Natura 2000 by a less firmly established and less influential coalition of land users and DG Agriculture. The discussion highlights the relationship between the involvement level of interest groups in the political process and the acceptance level of legislation among their members, also with regard to the EU enlargement and the transposition of EU legislation.

ID PREDICTION
AB A dynamic programming-based neural network model is developed for analysing the water sharing between two reservoirs in a multi-reservoir system catering for irrigation. To study the water sharing between two downstream reservoirs from an upstream reservoir, a modified dynamic programming algorithm with three state variables and four decision variables is proposed. The operating policies are derived from the three state variable dynamic programming algorithm using a neural network. The new dynamic programming neural network model gives a very good performance for the multi-reservoir system case study considered. The performance of this model is compared with the improvised standard operating policy and constrained dynamic programming neural network model previously suggested.

At his Republican convention, George Bush received positive coverage on character attributes as well as foreign and domestic policy issues. including those relating to race, which exemplified compassion or "heart" as some coverage gushed. He was also credited with running a positive campaign despite weekly press releases suggesting that Al Gore was a synthetic candidate. Negative coverage of Gore that occurred in television news during the preseason and primary election continued in online news during both conventions, as Core and vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman's speeches received positive coverage. Procedural issues. which are important for governance, along with Gore's environmental record were ignored.

ID SAN-SALVADOR-ISLAND; CORAL-REEFS; COMMUNITY; RESERVES
AB Marine protected areas were established in the Philippines as early as 1974. These early models on Sumilon and Apo Islands and others set forth a framework for coral reef management that has been shown to enhance fish yields to traditional fishers as well as protect and maintain nearshore coral reef habitats for biodiversity and multiple economic uses. The history of marine protected areas in the Philippines is described in relation to their present context. Devolution of authority for management of natural resources to local governments (municipalities and cities) in 1991 is highlighted as a major national policy shift that has supported more localized management efforts. Current policies and laws that influence marine protected areas are explained in relation to field management and results. One community and local government based marine protected area on San Salvador Island is contrasted with a National Marine Park being implemented under the National Integrated Protected Areas System. Important lessons include, among others: the importance of a well-articulated process that includes community participation and ownership in collaboration with municipal governments; the role of multiple stakeholders, government, and donor agencies in planning and management; the creative use of financial mechanisms to create long-term self-supporting marine protected areas; and the need for more integrated forms of coastal management to support marine protected area networks through broad area planning.

AB Recent events, such as the California energy crisis, the failures of the UK's railways, and the consequences of the third-generation (3G) mobile licence auctions, have called into question the European reliance on a strategy of network industry, liberalization. Substantial concentration in energy and telecoms markets has also raised the issue of the consistency of competition policy with the creation of internal energy and communications markets. The paper considers the multiple market failures in these industries, and the problems raised by a series of national policy approaches which fail fully to reflect the economies of scale and scope and the European-level public goods. Security, of supply in energy, the roll-out of broadband, and the gains for an overarching approach to climate change require a more European focus. This in turn will require institutional reform at the European level. Failure to address this Europe-wide agenda will leave Europe behind the USA.

TI The Swiss energy policy elite: The actor constellation of a policy
   domain in transition
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK; IMPLEMENTATION
AB In the actor-centered institutionalist approach of Fritz Scharpf (1997), `actor constellations' constitute the crucial link between substantive policy analysis and interaction-oriented policy research. This paper presents an attempt to conceptualize the `actor constellation' in a given policy domain and to analyze it empirically with network analysis. The empirical context is provided by the Swiss energy policy elite in the late 1990s - an example of a policy domain in transition between two policy equilibria. Based on interviews with 240 of the core actors in this policy elite, the results show a characteristic antagonism between a pro-ecology and a pro-growth coalition. On the national level, the two coalitions are of comparable size and power, which explains the current impasse in the policy domain in question. Moreover, in a federalist state like Switzerland, the energy policy elite is not concentrated at the center, but the basic antagonism is reproduced in each region nationwide. Confirming the consensus character of Swiss politics, the different components of the two antagonist coalitions not only cooperate within, but also across coalitions. These cooperative ties and the presence of honest brokers, policy enterpreneurs, and heterogeneous interests within each coalition provide opportunities for new alliances, which may lead out of the current impasse in the more or less near future.

AB Current approaches to energy are unsustainable and non-renewable. Implementing sustainable energy strategies is one of the most important levers humankind has for creating a sustainable world. Future energy policies should put more emphasis on developing the potential of energy sources, which should form the foundation of future global energy structure. The FAG, in support of the Sustainable Rural Environment and Energy Network (SREN), is developing a concept for the optimisation, evaluation and implementation of integrated renewable energy sources for rural communities.

ID CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT
AB This paper proposes an optimum bidding policy in a competitive network provider's environment, where each network provider can bid for individual connection requests according to its own criteria. The proposed bidding policy is based on the concept of "shadow price." In other words, each network provider bids only for connection requests with an expected profit exceeding its "shadow price." Because such connection request brings profit in the long term, each network provider can maximize its long-term profit by adopting this bidding policy. In this paper, the optimum bidding policy for network providers is analyzed by means of the policy iteration method derived from the Markov decision theory. The economic efficiency of the bidding policy is evaluated using several numerical examples, in which each network provider adopts fixed pricing and state-dependent pricing, respectively. By adopting the bidding policy in both cases, each network provider can maximize its long-term profit while the total users' consumer surplus is slightly reduced.

AB The Senegal River is the lifeline of the westernmost part of the sahelian zone in Africa. This zone has extreme problems with high population growth, rapid and uncontrolled urbanization, climate changes, widespread poverty, growing inequity, ethnic confrontations and stagnant economic development. This paper analyses the management system of Lac de Guiers-one of the largest lakes in West Africa-which is among the Senegal River's key management entities. A Bayesian network model is used to study the conflicting interests among the various stakeholders, the environmental and social concerns in the region and the viability of a series of policy options for water resources development.

AB The scope of the paper is to demonstrate, through the experience of the Lombardy Region, how the creation and the financial support of a network of local energy agencies can greatly enhance the correct use of energy and the promotion of renewable energy sources at a local level.
   After showing the nature and the structure of the local energy agencies, this paper focuses upon the most important actions carried out by the Network in the last 3 years of activities. The creation of these technical structures on the territory is a small but concrete answer to the need of an energy policy oriented towards sustainability. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The present article gives an overview on the leading concepts and modelling approaches for marine ecosystems' research including (1) The trophodynamic theory of pelagic ecosystems, (2) Compartment/network models, (3) Mesocosm experiments and (4) Individual based modelling approaches and virtual ecosystems (VE). The main research questions addressed, as well as the potential and limits of each approach, are summarized and discussed and it is shown how the concept of ecosystem has changed over time. Aquatic biomas spectra (derived from the theory of pelagic ecosystems) can give insight into the trophic structure of different systems, and can show how organism sizes are distributed within the system and how different size groups participate in the system's metabolism and production. Compartment/network models allow for a more detailed description of the trophic structure of ecosystems and of the energy/biomass fluxes through the explicit modelling of P/B-and food consumption rates and biomasses for each system compartment. Moreover, system indices for a characterization and comparison with other systems can be obtained such as average trophic efficiency, energy throughput, and degree of connectivity, degree of maturity, and others. Recent dynamic extensions of trophic network models allow for exploring past and future impacts of fishing and environmental disturbances as well as to explore policies such as marine protected areas. Mesocosm experiments address a multitude of questions related to aquatic processes (i.e. primary production, grazing, predation, energy transfer between trophic levels etc.) and the behaviour of organisms (i.e. growth, migration, response to contaminants etc.) under semi-natural conditions. As processes within mesocosms often differ in rate and magnitude from those occurring in nature, mesocosms should be viewed as large in vitro experiments designed to test selected components of the ecosystem and not as an attempt to enclose a multitude of interacting processes. Models that use individual organisms as units can provide insight into the causes of natural variability within populations (growth, phenotype, behaviour) and into the role of intraspecific variation for interspecific processes, succession, and feedback mechanisms. In biological oceanography, interdisciplinary research is increasingly using "Virtual Ecosystems" to simulate non-linear interactions between the dynamics of fluctuating ocean circulation, the physics of air-sea interaction, turbulence and optics, biogeochemistry, and the physiology and behaviour of plankton, which can be compared with real observations. The different approaches available for the analysis of aquatic ecosystems should be seen as complementary ways for the description and understanding of ecosystems. The modem view of marine ecosystems, as has emerged from ecosystem analysis over the last decades, is that of a composite of loosely coupled subsystems of desynchron dynamics which through their combined action maintain the fundamental structure and function of the whole.

AB Using the energy-and-power evaluation program (ENPEP), which is a simulation-model, detailed predictions for the primary and final energy consumptions. electricity demands and generation-capability expansion plans, during the period 2000-2015, in Jordan, have been computed. Also, based on the Government's published policies and plans, greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions emanating from the electricity sector and the associated proposed mitigation measures are discussed briefly. The future use of natural gas as a fuel, as a substitute for heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel, is recommended. Renewable energy technologies should be promoted, especially in proven applications, such as water heating and pumping, where their economics are attractive. Other actions, such as reducing losses in the generation system as well as the transmission and distribution networks will contribute positively to CO2-emissions mitigation in Jordan.

TI Getting beyond the 'official line': Reflections on dilemmas of access,
   knowledge and power in researching policy networks
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRISON; USERS; DRUGS
AB Although the policy network approach has moved to the forefront of the debates around the formulation and development of policy, there is a paucity of methodological and reflexive literature which explores how policy networks and the actors within these arenas are actually studied. Researching powerful individuals within such networks generates a unique set of dilemmas and complexities for the researcher. Drawing on my experiences of researching the policy networks involved in the development of prison drugs policy, this paper provides a methodological and reflexive account of the key processes and issues involved in my research. In particular, it explores the political dimensions of the research problem and the importance of switching the research gaze from the 'objects' of policy to those who are in the powerful positions of 'making' policy. In order to understand the interactions within the policy process, it is argued that the qualitative approach offers distinct advantages in studying policy networks. The paper examines my attempts to uncover and understand the role and influence of policy networks in the development of prison drugs policy and the ways in which I grappled with the dilemmas of access, knowledge and power which emerged during the course of the fieldwork. Although the importance of transparent methodologies and reflexivity are highlighted, the paper concludes by suggesting that the resistance on the part of researchers to providing such accounts is related to the pressures and constraints of the current academic climate.

AB In order to promote the sustainable use of biomass in Latin America and other emerging countries it is the general objective of this Thematic Network to establish a trans-national forum of Knowledge Centres (Universities and R&D Institutes) and SMEs from Latin America and other emerging countries and the European Union. The activities of the Thematic Network include the analysis of existing energy policy frameworks, the assessment of energy demand and biomass resources, the analysis of available bioenergy technologies and systems as well as the development and implementation of policy options for the promotion of bioenergy. The main focus,will thereby be on the promotion of small- and medium-scale decentralised bioenergy systems and the large-scale implementation of bioethanol. production and generation of heat and electricity based on sugar cane and other suitable biomass resources.

AB Both studies of federations and studies of policy net-works have sought to produce explanations for observed patterns of policy divergence and designs. However, both have evolved in parallel, insights rarely transferring from one to the other. This article reconciles tire two types of studies. More specifically, it provides an understanding of the divergent efforts of the United States and Canada with regard to the adoption of environmental regulations for the agricultural sector, which emphasizes the establishment of policy networks through interactions between past policy decisions and federal arrangements. The American federal structure, when combined with unrelated agricultural policy decisions, shaped policy networks in such a way as to enable the adoption of stringent environmental regulations for agriculture. In contrast, the Canadian federal structure, also in conjunction with past policy decisions, prevented the creation of policy networks capable enough to design similarly stringent agro-environmental regulations.

AB China's economic growth over the past several decades has been among the highest in the world. It has been fueled by cheap fossil fuel energy so energy consumption has risen rapidly, but there are signs that negative feedbacks in the form of waste and inefficiency may affect future development. If energy throughput exceeds the capacity of the environment to process the inevitable waste from production then the development may not be sustainable. We calculate economic diversity using an energy flow network analysis method to explore the relationships of development policy, energy use, efficiency and sustainable development. China and its provinces are presented as a case study and the development status of each province in China is presented. China's development policy does not appear to be sustainable over the period 1985-1998 because of unsustainable energy consumption trends and declining economic diversity. An energy consumption tax is proposed for increasing diversity and dealing with increasing energy consumption in China. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This is the introduction to this special issue of Small Business Economics, dedicated to networks, opportunity, internationalization and policy. As the drivers of globalization are removing barriers, which traditionally segmented the competitive environments of small and large firms, firms of all sizes are joining international networks. Former competitors are now working together and this symbiosis is enhancing competitiveness. Consequently, networking is giving rise to unprecedented opportunities, facilitating internationalization. Simultaneously, new realities are creating the need for new policies.

DE firewall; formal specification; security policy
AB Rules are used as a way of managing and configuring firewalls to fulfill security requirements in most cases. Managers have to specify their organizational security policies using low level and order-dependent rules. Furthermore, dependency of firewalls to the network topology, frequent changes in network topology (specially in dynamic networks), and lack of a method for analysis and verification of specified security policy may reduce to inconsistencies and security holes. Existence of a higher level environment for security policy specification can rectify part of the problems. In this paper we present a language for high level and formal specification of security policy in firewalls. Using the language, a security manager can configure its firewall based on his required security policy independent of the network topology. The language is used as a framework for analysis and verification of security policies. We designed and implemented a tool based on theorem proving for detecting inconsistencies, coverage, as well as applying a query on the specified policy. Results of analysis can be used to detect security vulnerabilities.

AB Noncrop areas such as hedgerows in agricultural landscapes can perform several ecological and agronomic functions (e.g., habitat, movement corridors, windbreak, etc.), but their dynamics and drivers of changes are often poorly known. We conducted a study in three agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec, Canada, to assess and compare the spatial and temporal (1958-1997) dynamics of three hedgerow networks in relation to geomorphic conditions (marine, glacial, and mixed deposit) and land-use changes. Hedgerow networks were mapped and described in terms of their structure (density, degree of connectivity, and presence of trees or shrubs) and their relationship to other components of the landscape (connection to woodland). Relationships were assessed in time and space using nonparametric correlation, Mantel test, and principal components analysis (PCA). Results show significant differences between hedgerow structure for the three landscapes and distinct temporal and spatial dynamics that can be related to changes in management practices and agricultural policies. On marine deposits, increases in hedgerow density did not always correspond to an increase in their degree of connectivity, suggesting a possible reduction in network quality. On glacial deposits, hedgerow density declined following abandonment of agricultural land, but rather than disappearing, these linear structures were integrated into adjacent brush or forested areas. Our analysis reveals the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of the hedgerow networks and highlights the need to take into account spatial attributes such as connectivity and connection to woodland to evaluate more accurately overall network quality.

TI Making EU network markets competitive
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the late 1980s the EU has made great strides in the liberalization of network markets. This article assumes a horizontal perspective, juxtaposing different network markets while focusing solely on the rules and policies at EU level. A six step checklist is applied to facilitate a comparative analysis of EU regulatory liberalization in gas, electricity, telecoms, postal services, and rail and air transport. Competition policy is discussed with respect to: the relation between regulation and competition policy; the role of the EC Curt; the 'essential facility' doctrine; defining relevant markets; and merger control in network industries. Finally, the question is addressed as to whether these network industries operate in an EC internal market. The answer is no. Policy recommendations: the EU defines a well-considered overall strategy for network market liberalization; the issue of the internal market with common regulators, at least where a subsidiarity test is passed, should be squarely addressed.

AB Efficiency in the management of electricity transmission networks is essential for the success of the liberalized energy markets. The paper is dedicated to the short-run management problems of these natural monopolies. It analyses how to organize and price access to and use of the transport network. After presenting the technical and institutional features of the electricity industry, the paper develops the normative approach of first-best and second-best pricing by means of nodal prices. Then the exercise of market power at some nodes and its consequences for the transport system operator are examined. The remaining part is more policy oriented, describing and analysing the practical solutions implemented in the European Union for energy transport pricing. The paper concludes with some remarks about the enforcement of antitrust rules in electricity transport.

AB Nutrient enrichment of coastal waters is an example of the large-scale, highly complex environmental challenges facing decision makers today. Conventional monitoring networks and advanced observational capabilities permit the detection of changes in the environment at continental to global scales (e.g., hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, aerosol plumes stretching across the ocean, global atmospheric enrichment of carbon dioxide). Much more knowledge is needed, however, to fully understand the societal consequences of environmental change and of actions taken to address diem. This paper discusses the emerging role of assessment in developing effective U.S. policy responses to large-scale, complex environmental change while improving the scientific understanding of the problem. In the cases of global climate change and coastal hypoxia, the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing assessments recognizing that decision making must proceed in the face of scientific uncertainty. Evaluating the state of knowledge is usually the first step in an assessment in order to provide a picture of what is known and where there are knowledge gaps. Assessments should also provide the policy maker with an idea of the level of uncertainty, how long it may take to reduce the uncertainty, what information is most critical to resolve, and the consequences and benefits of the various management options. In this paper I draw upon several examples from national assessments, including those of climate change impacts on the U.S. and relationships between Mississippi River water and Gulf of Mexico water quality, to illustrate the strengths and difficulties of using science and assessment to inform the policy process.

TI Firewalls - evolve or die
SO BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Businesses have traditionally relied on perimeter firewalls to enforce their security policy. However, perimeter controls do not provide a comprehensive solution to secure a private network connected to the Internet. This paper describes how the dynamic business environment and techniques, such as protocol tunnelling, have leveraged the use of IP networks. The use of these protocols and techniques means that perimeter firewalls alone no longer provide sufficient security. IPsec network security is reviewed and it is shown how its security services can be used to provide greater protection for the network by securing connections end to end. The paper also describes tools for firewall and VPN policy management that address the problem of managing the overall security policy with network implementations comprising multiple vendors' products. Finally, the paper proposes a vision of how future secure virtual networks will be established over existing infrastructures.

AB It is quite necessary that an organization's information network should be equipped with a proper security system based on its scale and importance. One of the effective methods is to use the simulation model for deciding which security policy and mechanism is appropriate for the complex network. Our goal is to build a foundation of knowledge-based modeling and simulation environment for the network security. Within this environment, users can construct the simulation model of security mechanisms, apply various security policies, and quantitatively analyze their security performance against possible attacks. In this study, we considered security domain and implemented the models based on a systematic modeling approach. We enabled the model to include knowledge in modular fashion and provided well-defined guidelines for transforming security policy to concrete rule set.

AB The rapid growth of the mobile environment has been resulted in servicing not only voice data but also multimedia data. Specially, mobility is a significant feature in mobile environment. In this paper, we propose a multimedia transmission architecture to exploit the mobility in the mobile multimedia network. This architecture can provide seamless communication by overlapping regions among foreign networks in a mobile multimedia network. We propose a bandwidth negotiation policy which a foreign network can admit more requests of new mobile hosts. And the policy can control fairly the differences of allocated bandwidth of foreign networks.

ID KNOWLEDGE; CAPABILITIES; NETWORKS
AB The objective of this paper is to examine the structures and processes of learning in industrial systems. Put briefly, we argue that learning is not a purely firm-based phenomenon and that it is partly dependent on the distribution of capabilities in the wider system in which the firm is embedded. The governance structures that sustain a particular division of labor in an industrial system play a key role in enabling some forms of learning and constraining others. We classify governance structures as falling under three categories - market, hierarchy, and business relationships - and explore learning implications for all three. Using a case study, of a Kenyan firm that designs and manufactures wind-powered water pumps, we examine in detail the processes of learning that occurred over a 17-year period at an intra and interorganizational level. Finally, we extract some conclusions as to how these processes were affected by the governance structures that the firm used to control and access the capabilities that it needed to design and manufacture its products.

AB Modern environmental policy implementation in many developed countries is increasingly regionally oriented. Regional governments have undertaken measures designed for the specific needs of the region but, so far the resulting change in environmental quality has hardly been monitored. This study develops a method for the quantitative evaluation of region-specific environmental policy. Two forms of monitoring are distinguished: monitoring of performance of policy measures and monitoring of environmental quality. This study investigates two regions in the Netherlands where region-specific policy has been implemented. Performance monitoring focused on reduction of nitrate leaching to groundwater. Leaching reductions were calculated with simple models or rules of thumb. Quality monitoring focused on nitrate concentrations under grassland and other land use. An analysis of variance showed significant differences between different soil units. Stratified kriging was applied for spatial interpolation, showing within-unit variability. The current monitoring network could be improved by using a more regular type of grid. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

ID VALUES
AB Agroforestry networks can be a means to achieve landscape amelioration. Some authorities of the Lagoon of Venice drainage basin (Italy) are planning, amongst other actions to control pollution in the Lagoon, to reintroduce agroforestry by means of a GIS-supported design procedure. The goals of this paper were to assess (i) the contingent valuation (CV) (willingness to pay and willingness to accept) of agroforestry networks and its relationship with socioeconomic and agroforestry role variables, (ii) the coherence between agro-economic policies and farmers expectations, (iii) the relationship between the value of agroforestry as a "shared good" and water quality (non-point source pollution). Respondents associate a positive value/preference to the agroforestry network implementation, although this value is strongly affected firstly by their identity with the landscape and secondly by their income. The motivations of farmers' evaluation are precise and the agroforestry network is considered not only as an "ethical object" but also as a concrete element of their own cultural and economic world. In this case the contingent value (in particular, in terms of acceptance) increases with the farmer's economic capacity, and the farmer's valuation is not linked only to the "good" but also to the "service" offered for implementing it. The expectations of farmers regarding an agroforestry plantation were lower than European Union incentives at the time of survey, and a lack of results in this field is probably linked to poor information and to bureaucratic difficulties. Even if there is general knowledge on water quality, there is little awareness on the non-point source pollution control effect of agroforestry buffer plantations, either in the common people or in those who are environmentally trained (e.g. planning university students). In every case the agroforestry "shared good" evaluation is high enough to permit efficient and supported intervention policies. These results confirm that landscape choices strongly involve issues of identity, perceived rights and evaluation capacity that cannot be simply resolved in terms of preference cost benefit analyses, but a clever use of the CV allows an identification of these same limitations and a partial estimation of them.

AB This paper considers a hub network design problem where the network service area partitioned into the predetermined zones (represented by node clusters) is given, and non-stop (direct link) service is allowed. The objective is to design a hub network under non-restrictive networking policy by determining all the required hub locations in the predetermined zones and also all the terminal-to-terminal routes such that the total network cost (hub construction and dow transportation cost) is minimized. For the design problem, a dual-based solution approach is proposed and tested for its effectiveness with numerical examples. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This conceptual paper argues that the emergence of Internet commerce is presenting a significant challenge to traditional internationalization explanations. Given rapid accessibility to customers and suppliers around the world, businesses appear to be turning towards networks of cooperation rather than external control structures. International supply chain management is proposed as a process of internationalization representing the implementation of a global uncertainty-driven neu; network orientation. A network orientation is proposed to encourage more integrated levels of I-commerce adoption which, in turn, further strengthens the relationship between a network orientation and its implementation. A number of propositions are presented along with a discussion of future research issues.

AB Current research and problems in science and technology policy are reviewed. Trends in innovative activity in the G-7 economies during the past two decades are summarized and the economic rationale for policy in this area given. Policy tools currently in use in many countries include tax credits and subsidies, the intellectual property system, and competition policy. Ongoing areas of current controversy are the interaction of intellectual property and competition policies, environmental and innovation policy, standard-setting in industries characterized by network externalities, and the privatization of scientific research and its consequences.

DE data replication; distributed databases; satellite networks
AB We consider the problem of data dissemination in a broadcast network. In contrast to previously studied models, broadcasting is among peers, rather than client server. Such a model represents, for example, satellite communication among widely distributed nodes, sensor networks, and mobile ad hoc networks. We introduce a cost model for data dissemination in peer to peer broadcast networks. The model quantifies the tradeoff between the inconsistency of the data, and its transmission cost; the transmission cost may be given in terms of dollars, energy, or bandwidth. Using the model we first determine the parameters for which eager (i.e. consistent) replication has a lower cost than lazy (i.e. inconsistent) replication. Then we introduce a lazy broadcast policy and compare it with several naive or traditional approaches to solving the problem.

AB We consider the problem of data dissemination in a broadcast network. In contrast to previously studied models, broadcasting is among peers, rather than client server. Such a model represents, for example, satellite communication among widely distributed nodes, sensor networks, and mobile ad-hoc networks. We introduce a cost model for data dissemination in peer to peer broadcast networks. The model quantifies the tradeoff between the inconsistency of the data, and its transmission cost; the transmission cost may be given in terms of dollars, energy, or bandwidth. Using the model we first determine the parameters for which eager (i.e. consistent) replication has a lower cost than lazy (i.e. inconsistent) replication. Then we introduce a lazy broadcast policy and compare it with several naive or traditional approaches to solving the problem.

DE voluntary agreements; policy mix; Denmark; energy efficiency
AB In this paper the Danish agreement scheme on energy efficiency in industry is described and evaluated. The basis for this evaluation is an implementation study of the agreement scheme and five evaluation criteria examining the practical considerations related to the choice of policy instruments. A distinct feature of the Danish scheme is that it is closely connected to a CO, tax on trade and industry. This connection is important for the understanding and the functioning of the scheme. The scheme has certain advantages: the prevention of free riding is effective, the scheme is flexible over time and the agreements do actually have an impact on firm behaviour. But there are also drawbacks: the administrative costs and search costs are high and the impact on innovation and networking among firms is low. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All tights reserved.

TI Southern California water markets: Potential and limitations
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
DE California; optimization; water supply; economic factors; water use
ID TRANSFERS
AB This paper explores the potential and limitations for southern California water markets using an economic-engineering network flow optimization model, CALVIN. CALVIN is used to estimate how a market would affect overall southern California water use, to preliminarily assess the economic benefit of more flexible water allocation policies, and to explore the characteristics of an ideal market. Results from CALVIN suggest substantial economic and reliability benefits exist for implementing water market or other transfer mechanisms, and these benefits could be achieved with relatively little reallocation of agricultural water. An ideal water market in southern California would reduce more costly urban water shortages, reducing the demand for increased imports from outside of southern California. Additionally, substantial economic benefits could accrue from expanding some conveyance and storage facilities, particularly the Colorado River Aqueduct and conjunctive use storage capacity.

AB In this paper, a neural networks (NNs) based two-phase routing algorithm is proposed. The aim of the first phase is to find a set of alternative routes for each commodity, while the traffic of each commodity is optimally distributed on the alternative routes in the second phase. Our final goal is to route all messages so that the average time delay of a message is minimized. Since the Hopfield neural network (HNN) can only solve problems whose energy functions can be expressed as quadratic forms, the expression of the average time delay of a packet needs first to be simplified and then explicitly included into the energy function. Our algorithm is applied to two network models, both of which have been previously analyzed by other researchers using mathematical methods. Compared with previous results, the proposed algorithm considerably reduces the time delay a packet encounters. A large number of experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithm has very good stability. Our work provides a possible routing policy for future high-speed communication networks due to the fact that a hardware-implemented NN can achieve an extremely high response speed.

AB Ecological monitoring and its associated research programs have often provided answers to various environmental management issues. In the face of changing environmental conditions, ecological monitoring provides decision-makers with reliable information as they grapple with maintaining a sustainable economy and healthy environment. The Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN) is a national ecological monitoring network consisting of (1) about 100 case study sites across the country characterized by long-term multi-disciplinary environmental work conducted by a multitude of agencies (142 partners and counting); (2) a variety of less comprehensive yet more extensive monitoring sites; (3) a network where core monitoring variables of ecosystem change are measured; and (4) geo-referenced environmental observations. Environment Canada is the coordinating partner for the network through the EMAN Co-ordinating Office. EMAN's mission is to focus a scientifically-sound policy-relevant ecosystem monitoring and research network based on (a) stabilizing a network of case-study sites operated by a variety of partners, and (b) developing a number of cooperative dispersed monitoring initiatives in order to deliver unique and needed goods and services. These goods and services include: (1) an efficient and cost-effective early warning system which detects, describes and reports on changes in Canadian ecosystems at a national or ecozone scale; and (2) cross-disciplinary and cross-jurisdictional assessments of ecosystem status, trends and processes. The early warning system and assessments of ecosystem status. trends and processes provide Environment Canada and partner organizations with timely information that facilitates increasingly adaptive policies and priority setting. Canadians are also informed of changes and trends occurring in Canadian ecosystems and, as a result, are better able to make decisions related to conservation and sustainability.

TI A heuristic search approach for a nonstationary stochastic shortest path
   problem with terminal cost
SO TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE

AB We present a best-first heuristic search approach for determining an optimal policy for a stochastic shortest path problem. A vehicle is to travel from an origin, starting at time to, to a destination, where once the destination is reached a terminal cost is accrued. The terminal cost depends on the time of arrival. Travel time along each arc in the network is modeled as a random variable with a distribution dependent on the time that travel along the arc is begun. The objective is to determine a routing policy that minimizes expected total cost. A routing policy is a rule that assigns the next arc to traverse, given the current node and time.
   The heuristic search algorithm that we specialize to this stochastic problem is AO*. We demonstrate the significant computational advantages of AO*, relative to dynamic programming, on the basis of run time and storage, using a 131-intersection network of the major roads in Cleveland, Ohio. Further computational experience is based on grid networks that were randomly generated to have characteristics similar to transportation networks, and on randomly generated unstructured networks.

AB This paper describes a sample of over 900 vessel accidents that occurred on the lower Mississippi River. Two different techniques, one statistical and the other based on a neural network model, were used to build logical groups of accidents. The objective in building the groups was to maximize between-group variation and minimize within-group variation. The result was groups whose records were as homogenous as possible.
   A clustering algorithm (i.e., a non-inferential statistical technique) generated sets of three, four and five groups. A Kohenen neural network model (i.e., a self-organizing map) also generated sets of three, four and five groups. The two sets of parallel groups were radically different as to the relative number of records in each group. In other words, when the two sets of groups were constructed by the respective techniques, the membership of each comparable group within the two different sets was substantially different.. Not only was the respective record count in each group substantially different, so were the descriptive statistics describing each comparable set of groups.
   These results have significant implications for marine policy makers. Important policy variables include safety factors such as weather, speed of current, time of operation, and location of accidents, but mandatory utilization of a voluntary vessel tracking service may be subject to debate.

   in European regulation
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE general-interest goals; infrastructure networks; market integration;
   public monopolies; public services; public utilities; service provision
AB Although the goal of market integration has not actually been challenged in recent years, it has nevertheless increasingly come to be considered incomplete and in need of complementary goals which serve the general interest by promoting social cohesion and equality. The debate has been conducted in various areas, such as in the fight against unemployment and poverty and in the provision of public utilities. In the latter case, regarding the provision of energy, water, communication and transport, the debate was sparked by the privatization of public monopolies and their infrastructure networks, and the deregulation of service provision. The network industries, which had traditionally been shielded from competition and were run within national boundaries, were dramatically transformed. This change, which in some countries resulted from European legislation, was meant to induce more producer competition, improved productivity, more consumer choice in the supply of network services, and lower prices. However, it has triggered concerns over the maintenance of general-interest goals in service provision, i.e. over safeguarding the accessibility, equality, continuity, security and affordability of these services after liberalization. There is a general political consensus that communicating by voice telephony, enjoying a certain degree of mobility, and using energy are basic needs which should be guaranteed and that firms operating in network industries should thus be subject to 'public-service' objectives. This contribution raises the questions: why, and to what extent, does a conflict exist between economic liberalization and general-interest goals in the first place? I then turn to the role of European policymaking, which aims at striking a balance between the poles of market integration and competition, on the one hand, and the provision of public services, on the other. What are the existing European policies and how do they fare when measured against these two goals? I then focus on the central question of the analysis: how can the pro-general-interest decisions at the cross-sectoral and sectoral level (in energy, telecommunications and rail) be accounted for in terms of the interaction of the formal political and legal actors involved in shaping the outcomes at the European level?

ID VARYING TRANSPORTATION; SHORTEST PATHS
AB The best routing policy problem in stochastic and time-dependent networks is the subject of this study. This problem can be viewed as a counterpart of the shortest-path problem in deterministic networks. A stochastic time-dependent network is one in which the link travel times are random variables with time-dependent distributions. A routing policy is a decision rule that specifies what node to take next at each decision node on the basis of the realized link travel times and the current time. The framework of the problem is reviewed, on which basis one of the variants of the problem that are pertinent to the traffic context is studied. An exact algorithm to this variant is given, and its complexity is analyzed. Since the running time of the exact algorithm is generally exponential in the number of arcs, the importance of finding good approximations to the exact algorithm is pointed out. Several approximations are presented, and their effectiveness against the exact algorithm is studied both theoretically and computationally.

AB Human society has used freshwater from rivers, lakes, groundwater,, and wetlands for many different urban, agricultural, and industrial activities, but in doing so has overlooked its value in supporting ecosystems. Freshwater is vital to human life and societal well-being, and thus its utilization for consumption, irrigation, and transport has long taken precedence over other commodities and services provided by freshwater ecosystems. However, there is growing recognition that functionally intact and biologically complex aquatic ecosystems provide many economically valuable services and long-term benefits to society. The short-term benefits include ecosystem goods and services, such as food supply, flood control, purification of human and industrial wastes, and habitat for plant and animal life-and these are costly, if, not impossible, to replace. Long-term benefits include the sustained provision of those goods and services, as well as the adaptive capacity of aquatic ecosystems to respond to future environmental alterations, such as climate change. Thus, maintenance of the processes and properties that support freshwater ecosystem integrity should be included in debates over sustainable water resource allocation.
   The purpose of this report is to explain how the integrity of freshwater ecosystems depends upon adequate quantity, quality, timing, and temporal variability of water flow. Defining these requirements in a comprehensive but general manner provides a better foundation for their inclusion in current and future debates about allocation of water resources. In this way the needs of freshwater ecosystems can be legitimately recognized and addressed. We also recommend ways in which freshwater ecosystems can be protected, maintained, and restored.
   Freshwater ecosystem structure and function are tightly linked to the watershed or catchment of which they are a part. Because riverine networks, lakes, wetlands, and their connecting groundwaters, are literally the "sinks" into 'Which landscapes drain, they are greatly influenced by terrestrial processes, including many human uses or modifications of land and water. Freshwater ecosystems, whether lakes, wetlands, or rivers, have specific requirements in terms of quantity, quality, and seasonality of their water supplies. Sustainability normally requires these systems to fluctuate within a natural range of variation. Flow regime, sediment and organic matter inputs, thermal and light characteristics, chemical and nutrient characteristics, and biotic assemblages are fundamental defining attributes of freshwater ecosystems. These attributes impart relatively unique characteristics of productivity and biodiversity to each ecosystem. The natural range of variation in each of these attributes is critical to maintaining the integrity and dynamic potential of aquatic ecosystems; therefore, management should allow for dynamic change. Piecemeal approaches cannot solve the problems confronting freshwater ecosystems.
   Scientific definitions of the requirements to protect and maintain aquatic ecosystems are necessary but insufficient for establishing the appropriate distribution between societal and ecosystem water needs. For scientific knowledge to be implemented science must be connected to a political agenda for sustainable development. We offer these recommendations as. a beginning to redress how water is viewed and managed in the United States: (1) Frame national and regional water management policies to explicitly incorporate freshwater ecosystem needs, particularly those related to naturally variable flow regimes and to the linking of water quality with water quantity; (2) Define water resources to include watersheds, so that freshwaters are viewed within a landscape, or systems context; (3) Increase communication and education across disciplines, especially among engineers, hydrologists, economists, and ecologists to facilitate an integrated view of freshwater resources; (4) Increase restoration efforts, using well-grounded ecological principles as guidelines; (5) Maintain and protect the remaining freshwater ecosystems that have high integrity; and (6) Recognize the dependence of human society on naturally functioning ecosystems.

AB German air transport is actually governed by two fundamentally different market regimes which belong to different geographical areas of the world: While intra-EU air transport as well as some other markets are fully liberalized, most air transport links with the rest of the world are still subject to regulation by restrictive air service agreements. This paper examines the effects of the coexistence of different market regimes on the spatial distribution of international traffic flows, and draws some conclusions with respect to the appropriate design of future German air transport policy.

AB Fuzzy classification techniques have been developed recently to estimate the class composition of image pixels, but their output provides no indication of how these classes are distributed spatially within the instantaneous field of view represented by the pixel. As such, while the accuracy of land cover target identification has been improved using fuzzy classification, it remains for robust techniques that provide better spatial representation of land cover to be developed. Such techniques could provide more accurate land cover metrics for determining social or environmental policy, for example. The use of a Hopfield neural network to map the spatial distribution of classes more reliably using prior information of pixel composition determined from fuzzy classification was investigated. An approach was adopted that used the output from a fuzzy classification to constrain a Hopfield neural network formulated as an energy minimization tool, The network converges to a minimum of an energy function, defined as a goal and several constraints, Extracting the spatial distribution of target class components within each pixel was, therefore, formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem with an optimal solution determined by the minimum of the energy function. This energy minimum represents a "best guess" map of the spatial distribution of class components in each pixel. The technique was applied to both synthetic and simulated Landsat TM imagery, and the resultant maps provided an accurate and improved representation of the land covers studied, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) for Landsat imagery of the order of 0.09 pixels in the new fine resolution image recorded. As such, we show how, by using a Hopfield neural network, more accurate measures of land cover targets can be obtained compared with those determined using the proportion images alone. The Hopfield neural network used in this way represents a simple, robust, and efficient technique, and results suggest that it is a useful tool for identifying land cover targets from remotely sensed imagery at the subpixel scale.

AB This study examines how external network ties determine a board's ability to contribute to the strategic decision making process. Although the simple number of director appointments to other boards does not affect board monitoring or advice on strategy, appointments that can provide directors with relevant strategic knowledge and perspective do predict such involvement. In effect, the strategic context of social network ties, not simply the number of ties, is an important influence on corporate governance.

TI QoS control by means of COPS to support SIP-based applications
SO IEEE NETWORK
LA English
DT Article
AB The COPS protocol has been designed to enable communication on the interface between the policy decision administrator and the policy enforcement devices in a policy-based networking environment, It can be recognized that on the some interface there is the need to transfer information related to the request of resource by QoS clients and for the allocation of resources by resource allocation servers (e.g., bandwidth broker) in a DiffServ network. Hence, it is sensible to add this resource allocation functionality in the COPS framework. In particular, there are at least two cases where it is sensible to use COPS. The first case is on the interface between an edge node and a resource control node for handling resource allocation in a network provider domain. The second case is on the interface between a customer (client of a QoS enabled network) and the network provider: here COPS can be used as a protocol to signal dynamic admission control requests. In this article we present the definition of a new COPS client type to support the above-mentioned functionality, then describe an application scenario where SIP-based IP telephony applications can use Diffserv-based QoS networks. Simple backward-compatible enhancements to SIP are needed to interact with COPS/Diffserv QoS. A testbed implementation of the proposed solutions is finally described.

AB Principal component analysis is a data reduction technique used to identify the important components or factors that explain most of the variance of a system. This technique was extended to evaluating a ground water monitoring network where the variables are monitoring wells. The objective was to identify monitoring wells that are important in predicting the dynamic variation in potentiometric head at a location. The technique is demonstrated through an application to the monitoring network of the Bangkok area. Principal component analysis was carried out for all the monitoring wells of the aquifer, and a ranking scheme based on the frequency of occurrence of a particular well as principal well was developed. The decision maker with budget constraints can now opt to monitor principal wells which can adequately capture the potentiometric head variation in the aquifer. This was evaluated by comparing the observed potentiometric head distribution using data from all available wells and wells selected using the ranking scheme as a guideline.

DE telecommunications versus transportation; emission paradoxes; network
   equilibrium; emission pricing policies
ID TRAFFIC EQUILIBRIUM
AB In this paper, we consider networks in which a link is characterized by zero emissions as is typical of networks in which certain links correspond to telecommunication links. We identify three new and distinct paradoxical phenomena that can occur in such networks, which demonstrate that so-called "improvements" to the network may result in increases in total emissions generated. In particular, we illustrate, through specific examples, the following: (1) the addition of a link with zero emissions may result in an increase in total emissions with no change in travel demand, (2) the total emissions on a network with a zero emission link may increase with a decrease in travel demand, and (3) the addition of a path connecting an origin/destination (O/D) pair and consisting solely of a zero emission link may result in an increase in total emissions. We then propose an emission pricing policy which guarantees that such paradoxes do not occur. The pricing policy is shown to be equivalent to a particular weighting mechanism associated with the criterion of emission generation provided that the users are now multicriteria decision-makers who seek to minimize both the cost of their route choices as well as the emissions that they generate.

AB Given the emergence of IP networks and the Internet as the multiservice network of the future, it is plausible to consider its use for transporting demanding traffic with high bandwidth and low delay and packet loss requirements. Emerging technologies for scalable quality of service such as Differentiated Services and MPLS can be used for premium quality traffic. We are looking at the problem of intra-domain provisioning in an automated manner from an Internet Service Provider's (ISPs) point of view, i.e. we want to satisfy the contracts with our customers while optimising the use of the network resources. We need to be able to dynamically guide the behaviour of such an automated provisioning system in order to be able to meet the high-level business objectives. The emerging policy-based management paradigm is the means to achieve this requirement. In this paper we devise first a non-linear programming formulation of the traffic engineering problem and show that we can achieve the objectives and meet the requirements of demanding customer traffic through the means of an automated provisioning system. We extend the functionality of the automated system through policies. We define resource provisioning policies, and we present example scenarios of their enforcement.

AB Quality of service (QoS) technology has been implemented and started to be applied to new applications on the next-generation Internet. However, as new applications have many kinds of features and requirements, some additional features should be added to current QoS control technology. For example, they require a definition of a single policy to operate QoS control in the management domain consistently and efficiently. Policy definition for transport layer in a domain and among domains is being discussed at IETF to set a standard process, however detailed policy corresponding to the application or contents information according to the application semantics has not been discussed. Therefore we developed QoS policy control mechanism using metadata which is defined as a structured data according to the application semantics. Though metadata and transport mechanism can be located into quite different positions in the concept of network layers, we made them successfully collaborated by defining meta policy. In this paper, we describe our approach to define a meta policy based on the requirements and information contents from the application as a high level layer concept to be able to classify the network behavior. Our approach enables to multiple QoS control and collaboration among domains. We also report of the activities in IETF and ITU-T.

AB In a continuously expanding mobile and wireless networking environment, mobile IP is the preferred standard responsible for providing Internet connectivity to roaming mobile nodes. Under certain conditions of traffic, such as in mobile IP networks supporting multimedia applications, overhead can cause delays at the mobility agents, i.e. foreign and home agents. While the mobile IP standard does not exclude the possibility of using multiple home agents, it does not impose any particular model either; therefore using only one home agent in a classic home network configuration can significantly bottleneck the IP data packet streams destined to the mobile nodes. In this paper, we develop a new simulator in order to evaluate the performance of a load balanced multiple home agents protocol extension, as well as several results obtained during a comprehensive simulation study of the system. We study several dynamic load balancing policies that distribute the traffic among several nodes in the home network, comparing the results obtained under different traffic shapes. We introduce a more realistic double-threshold load balancing policy, and compare its behaviour with that of other dynamic/static policies. Using simulation, we also analyze the impact of modifying the number of load balanced home agents on the overall system performance. The results show that some load balancing policies expected to perform better than others occasionally have an opposite behavior. This proves out to be highly dependent on the traffic pattern, especially its degree of burstiness.

AB This paper analyzes the relationship between governmental regulatory policies and competitive dynamics amongst private operators and the national monopolist, TP SA, in three network segments of the Polish telecommunications sector. Special attention is paid to the evolution of organizational strategies in a regulatory environment characterized by constant strategic indecision and reorientations of national policy makers. The paper finds that regulatory/competition coevolution has taken diverse forms in the three network subsegments, with asymmetric duopoly operating in the local fixed network, hidden competition at work in the long-distance fixed network, and oligopolistic technology-driven competition characterizing the high-growth cellular network. The conclusion reached is that Polish telecommunications to date has been stuck in a broad stage of pre-competitive market maneuverings by domestic and international capital, in preparation for privatization of the national operator and for full liberalization as part of EU integration.

AB As cooperative information systems (CIS) grow to cover large-scaled CIS that involves many cooperative sub-systems distributed geographically, management technologies that support them gain in importance. This paper focuses on the underlying technologies that are key to the success of cooperative information system, i.e., service management and network management, which are in the form of middleware, to assure inter-domain cooperation within a big CIS in a flexible, automated and secure way. This flexibility and automation is guaranteed by the use of Policy-based Network Management integrated with Mobile Agent Technology. Extending the mobile agent supporting environment, Grasshopper, to support more secure facilities, largely enhances the security. As a case study, IP Virtual Private Network tunnel between two geographically separated domains within a large-scaled CIS is set up and configured automatically and securely using the service and network management middleware, which shows that service and network management enhanced CIS can operate with more flexibility, automation, security and in a larger information system.

AB Commercial forestry is an important industry in South Africa, generating considerable employment and foreign exchange. The industry has grown rapidly since World War II with active government support. However, since the beginning of the transition to democracy in 1991, there have been increasingly vociferous attacks on the industry regarding its urban and big-business bias and its role in damaging the environment. The transition to democracy has brought a change in the structure or make-up of its stakeholders/actor constellations and the dynamics of policy change. As a result, a new network of actors, or coalition, who have different and diverse expectations from the industry, has emerged. This network's primary goal is to monitor and control the environmental functions of commercial forestry, as opposed to the old network whose actors have believed, and continue to do so, that commercial forestry's primary goal is profit maximization. Thc tension between the two has generated conflicts and the need for a change in the policy and institutions to ensure the sustainability of the industry. In this article, this process of policy change is explained with the help of an advocacy coalition framework; and a set of policy guidelines that might defuse the tension between the two coalitions and set the industry on a sustainable path is briefly discussed.

AB A new probabilistic analytical approach to evaluate seismic system reliability of large lifeline systems is presented in this paper. The algorithm takes the shortest path from the source to the terminal of a node weight or edge weight network as decomposition policy, using the Boolean laws of set operation and probabilistic operation principal, a recursive decomposition process then could be constructed. For a general weight network, the modified Torrieri method (NTR/T method) is introduced to combine with the suggested algorithm. Therefore, the recursive decomposition algorithm may be applied to evaluate the seismic reliability of general lifeline systems. A series of case studies, including a practical district electric power network system and a large urban water supply system, show that the suggested algorithm supplies a useful probabilistic analysis means for the seismic reliability evaluation of large lifeline systems.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of providing delay guarantees in a distributed environment, e.g., a wireless network or a cable network. In a distributed environment, the information of the arrival process is, in general, not available to the network. Due to the lack of such information, traffic regulators and scheduling policies discussed in the literature cannot be directly applied. To cope with the problem, we propose a distributed traffic regulator (DTR) that uses the information of the departure process. Based on such DTRs, we propose the distributed earliest deadline first (DEDF) scheduling policy. For the DEDF scheme, we derive an admission-control criterion and show that the maximum delay can be guaranteed if the criterion is satisfied.

DT Article

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY INTEGRATION; PERSPECTIVE; DELPHI; SECTOR
AB Issue network analysis techniques were applied to the issue of sustainable forestry in the United States to identify potential public and private outcomes for the issue. A quantitative approach based on work by Laumann and Knoke [The Organizational State (1987)] was utilized in conjunction with the Delphi method. Results suggest that the parity in the distribution of influence among network sectors means that moving the issue of sustainable forestry onto the formal policy agenda will require more consensus on problems and solutions than exists at the present time. Accordingly, broad policy actions resulting from the expansion of the issue of sustainable forestry are unlikely in the short-term. However, experts on the Delphi panel anticipate that changes will occur in response to sustainability issues. At the federal and state level, this is likely to result in changes to public forest management and to the objectives assigned to the USDA Forest Service and to the state forestry agencies. States are projected to draft new and to change old private forest practices regulations as a result of sustainable forestry concerns. In the private sector, the trend of applying criteria and indicator-based sustainable forestry management standards and certification programs will continue. Non-industrial private forest owners are projected to make the fewest direct accommodations. Finally, where directly comparable, the Delphi study's results were not significantly different from the quantitative approach, suggesting that Delphi has promise for network research applications.

TI How networks explain unintended policy implementation outcomes: The case
   of UK rail privatization
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB How a government secures the implementation of its policies is one of the most interesting processes in public administration. The tendency of scholars is to ignore implementation and how it impacts on the form of policy, something which invariably changes once resources have been allocated to implementing agencies and the policy detail is addressed. Traditional 'top-down' (Pressman and Wildavsky 1984; Mazmanian and Sabatier 1981) and 'bottom-up' (Elmore 1979; Hjern and Porter 1981,; Hull and Hjern 1983) analytical frameworks give only a partial explanation of outcomes. In making the case for a netwrok approach, a typology of implementation networks is presented. The utility of this typology is evaluated in the context of one of the most complex privatization programmes attempted by any,government: the privatization of British Rail (BR) between 1992 and 1997. In the case of the sale of one BR subsidiary train operating company, ScotRail, a variety of agencies with competing interests and acting in a politically-charged climate exchanged essential resources to deliver the policy, though not without generating unintended outcomes in the form of significant change to the policy and the agencies charged with implementing it.

AB This policy note describes the research into the congestion costs that Railtrack (the owner and manager of the railway infrastructure in the UK) faces in operating additional trains on the rail network. This work was undertaken as part of the first periodic review of Railtrack's access charges. This is the first time that such a detailed analysis of the relationship between capacity utilisation and train performance has been undertaken on a rail network. The paper defines capacity utilisation and identifies the key drivers of congestion costs: geography, time/day of operation, relative speed and flex. The results of the congestion cost research has been reflected in the. introduction of a new track access charge, known as the capacity charge.

AB This article aims to bring together insights from a broad body of recent literature concerned with the nature, the measurement and policy implications of benefits and costs of transport. It is argued that, for various reasons, transport cannot be treated as an 'ordinary' economic sector. and the policy implications of a number of the sector's peculiarities are addressed. Explicit attention is given to spatial aspects and network elements, internal and external benefits and costs, and efficiency aspects and equity considerations in policy making.

AB This paper describes the adaptability of communication software through a biologically-inspired policy coordination. Many research efforts have developed adaptable systems that allow various users or applications to meet their specific requirements by configuring different design and optimization policies. Navigating through many policies manually, however, is tedious and error-prone. Developers face the significant manual and ad-hoc work of engineering an system. In contrast, we propose to provide autonomous adaptability in communication endsystem with OpenWebServer/iNexus, which is both a web server and an object-oriented framework to tailor various web services and applications. The OpenWebServer's modular architecture allows to abstract and maintain a wide range of aspects in a HTTP server, and reconfigure the system by adding, deleting, changing, or replacing their policies. iNexus is a tool for automated policy-based management of OpenWebServer. Its design is inspired by the natural immune system, particularly immune network, a truly autonomous decentralized system. iNexus inspects the current system condition of OpenWebServer periodically, measures the delivered quality of service, and selects suitable set of policies to reconfigure the system dynamically by relaxing constraints between them. The policy coordination process is performed through decentralized interactions among policies without a single point of control, as the natural immune system does. This paper discusses communication software can evolve continuously in the piecemeal way with biological concepts and mechanisms, adapting itself to ever-changing environment.

TI The local roots of federal policy change: Transportation in the 1990s
SO POLITY
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRESENTATION
AB Although allegedly "all politics is local," studies of policy changes in the United States tend to emphasize national political cleavages, national issue-attention cycles, and inside-the-Beltway approaches to issue networks. We argue that more accurate and complete explanations of national policy changes require a broader consideration of problem definition and issue framing at the local level, as well as intergovernmental political pressures. Using hearing testimony, media coverage, and other data, we test this proposition by examining alterations to U.S. transportation policy in the 1990s. The reauthorizations of the federal transportation law in 1997 and 1998, which shifted considerable discretion away from states and toward previously weak metropolitan planning organizations, are typically viewed as major victories for mass transit and environmentalists. Our analysis suggests that a conventional explanation focusing on national factors like public opinion, interest group involvement, and Congressional membership provides less leverage in accounting for these substantive and procedural policy shifts than an explanation centered on local and intergovernmental factors.

AB Spatial aspects of economic policy are often important. However, multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have rarely explicitly treated geographical space. This paper develops a spatial-network. mixed-complementarity CGE model, incorporating formulations from partial-equilibrium programming models. We implement the model with a prototype data set for a stylized, poor, developing country with rural regions linked to an urban region that is linked to international markets. We demonstrate that the model provides a good framework for analyzing the impact of higher world prices and reduced domestic transportation costs and that the explicit incorporation of space has a strong impact on simulation results.

DT Article
ID MODELS; EQUILIBRIUM; ASSIGNMENT; DESIGN
AB The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 and its successor, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), changed the scope of the transportation planning process from evaluating new regional transportation facilities to developing strategies which promote more efficient use of the existing transportation infrastructure, and created a need for new and improved analytical tools to be used in the analysis and evaluation of intermodal networks. Transportation plans that are developed must consider a range of transportation options designed to meet the transportation needs of a state including all modes and their connections. Transportation planners need to investigate programs aimed at reducing our reliance on single-occupant vehicles and making alternatives such as transit, highoccupancy vehicle lanes, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities a more important part of the transportation program. This paper presents an efficient method for analyzing and evaluating intermodal commuter networks, modeling interactions between modes, making predictions regarding future network activity in terms of traffic volumes and travel costs, and aiding the decision making process in terms of future transportation plans by evaluating alternative policies for improving the efficiency of high occupancy modes, mitigating congestion, reducing energy consumption, and air pollution.

AB This paper investigates the sources of enterprise learning under transition, using the results of a recent survey conducted in six Central and East European countries. The analysis identifies three possible and interacting ways of enterprise learning: (1) learning by doing; (2) learning from the environment; and (3) learning from networks. Then it examines the spatial variations of the factors affecting learning by contrasting capital regions with western border regions and all sampled firms. The paper concludes that enterprise learning in transition economies is a spatially selective process, as most structural and behavioural factors tend to favour capital regions. Consequently, transition policies have to incorporate certain types of regional policy into their core, as a supplementary and balancing force to market-driven structural and spatial adjustments.

TI Strategic alliances and entrepreneurship in innovation diffusion and
   technology management - The emergent paradigm
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper dwells on aspects of innovation diffusion in the context of technology, management. The linear model of innovation diffusion has been replaced by two-way models. This calls for diffusion mechanisms based on cooperative or consortia type alliances for strategic advantages. It also calls for science based entreprenuership. even in public funded research agencies. The linkages with potential client have to be forged through specific policy initiatives and diffusion mechanisms like those found in OECD countries. The corporate vision in CSIR in India is aimed at creating condition's for contract research and an entrepreneurial research environment in public funded laboratories. Strategic research and promotion of tacit knowledge as well as people networks and high-tech training centres are found to be important component. The Japanese S&T policy and the changes in its key points are pointers to the importance of an innovation oriented industrial policies. S&T policies in India are also undergoing a transformation due to internationalization. The new science and technology (S&T) policy should facilitate proactive networking among research labs, private enterprise, and public agencies including financial institutions. The concurrent developments in research management practices are also highlighted.

TI Innovation, networks and plant location: Some evidence for Ireland
SO REGIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE innovation; networks; location; Ireland; clustering
ID R-AND-D; NORTHERN-IRELAND; TECHNOLOGY; POLICY
AB The influence of networks and location on plants' innovation activities has received considerable attention over the last decade. Most empirical work has centred on the hypotheses suggested by the urban hierarchy model. That is, that resource-rich, urban areas may be more conducive to product innovation while more rural areas are better suited to process change. This paper differentiates among four types of areas in Ireland (Urban, Urban-periphery, Rural, and Second Centre) and uses survey evidence to examine the impact of these different environments on plants' innovation activity. There are two main empirical conclusions. First, networks play an important part in determining the probability that plants will be innovative and, to a lesser extent, the success of that innovation. This provides some conditional support for recent calls for network-based regional development strategies. Secondly, there is no evidence of any urban hierarchy of innovation in Ireland, suggesting that regional policy initiatives to disperse economic activity throughout Ireland are likely to have had little effect on innovation.

AB During the past three decades environmental monitoring systems covering an immense variety of environmental problems emerged rapidly throughout the world. In The Netherlands the entire spectrum of monitoring systems is present. Their development is especially interesting because of the Dutch complex environmental landscape: a result of the combination of a natural setting with a high small-scale variation and an intense use of the available space by both industry and agriculture. This necessitates a well balanced environmental policy wherein monitoring of both environmental compartments and environmental policy itself plays an important role. In this article we focus on abiotic systems, whereby the development of monitoring will be related to that of environmental policy in general. Some general lines emerge: from quantity towards quality, from single pollutants towards environmentally harmful processes as a whole, and from a focus on human health and safety towards integrated environmental management. Because The Netherlands is a highly organized and highly educated society, reacting fast and flexible to new problems, this progression has happened quickly. However, still much remains to be desired and flexibility not necessarily guarantees optimal routes of development. Paramount is the development of sophisticated and robust monitoring systems that truly support integrated environmental management. This asks for clear objectives based on solid scientific insights.

TI Issues and initiatives surrounding rail freight transportation in Europe
SO TRANSPORTATION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY
AB This article reviews the current issues and initiatives related to rail freight transportation in Europe. Since the liberalization of transportation in the European Union (EU), rail freight transportation systems have not been as successfully integrated as passenger rail networks, or airline, motor carriage, or inland waterway systems. As a result, EU policy and directives are attempting to promote and develop increased use of rail freight and intermodal services to overcome the environmental and congestion problems caused by the disproportionate use of motor carriage in the EU. The over-reliance on trucking has become even more critical as the EU expands towards Eastern Europe. Key initiatives such as the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN), Pan-European Corridors (PAN), Transport Infrastructure Needs Assessment (TINA), and Pilot Actions for Combined Transport (PACT) are discussed. Finally, suggestions are offered that would enable EU rail freight carriers to provide more competitive services on. a Pan-European scale.

DE QoS management; policy-based management; management; environment
AB Providing QoS-guaranteed services in current installed networks is an important issue, but only the deploying QoS services is not enough to guarantee their success: QoS management must also be provided. Nowadays, police-based management addresses this need, but such management is not enough either. Network managers often deal with QoS tasks that cannot be performed using only policy-based management. This paper describes six important QoS management-related tasks (QoS implementation, operation maintenance, discovery, monitoring, analysis and visualization) and shows solutions that can help managers proceed with these tasks, Unfortunately, these solutions are independent from each other, leading to a scenario where integration is difficult, To solve this lack of integration, QAME (QoS-Aware Management Environment) has been developed. QAME provides support to allow the execution of the defined QoS tasks in an integrated fashion.

TI A neural network model for enhanced operation of midblock signalled
   pedestrian crossings
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE traffic; pedestrians; neural networks
AB UK transport policy has shifted dramatically in recent years. The new policy direction to promote walking as an alternative to car for short trips. Midblock signalled pedestrian crossings are a common method of resolving the conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. This paper considers alternative operating strategies for midblock signalled pedestrian crossings that are more responsive to the needs of pedestrians without increasing the delay to motorists and freight traffic. A succession of artificial neural network (ANN) models is developed and factors influencing the performance of pedestrian gap acceptance models both in terms of accuracy and processing requirements are considered in detail. The paper concludes that a feedforward ANN using backpropagation can deliver a gap acceptance model with a high degree of accuracy with acceptable constraints. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID EXPERT-SYSTEM; WATER-CONSERVATION; RESPONSIBILITIES
AB A decision support system has been developed for drought characterization and management. The purpose of the decision support system is to assist the operators and water managers of the water supply system of the City of Lexington, Kentucky. The motivation of this study was a severe drought that occurred in the state of Kentucky during the summer of 1988. The data derived from the City of Lexington, Kentucky and the Kentucky River Basin were employed in this study. The developed decision support system consists of three components: a water demand forecasting component, a streamflow forecasting component, and an integrated expert system component. The water demand and streamflow forecasting components of the decision support system predict the water consumption for the City of Lexington and the flow in Kentucky River at Lock 10 near Winchester, Kentucky, respectively. The lead time of the forecasting models was taken as five days as they were intended to be employed in developing a short-term drought management policy. Various modeling techniques ranging from regression and time series analysis to the relatively mew technique of expert systems and artificial neural networks were explored for forecasting both water demand and streamflow. The integrated expert system component consists of five sub-components. Each sub-component entails developing a knowledge base for a specific purpose. The expert system component integrates all sub-components and characterizes the drought potential in the coming five days and recommends a drought management policy for the week to come. The developed decision support system is capable of running on a personal computer and provides a user-friendly platform for decision-makers to explore a wide range of drought management alternatives.

DE school health; asthma; policy
AB Schools are faced with the challenging mandate of addressing the learning needs of students while simultaneously managing a gamut of behavior and health problems. School health policies have been successfully used for many health-related issues. Although asthma is the most common chronic disease among children, schools receive only a small amount of support to manage asthma issues. This article describes our experiences in developing an asthma policy in schools. The problem of asthma in schools was assessed as part of a comprehensive community-based asthma intervention, and a plan was established to develop a school asthma policy. The goal of the policy was to facilitate a physical and social environment that enabled students with asthma to control optimally their condition. have a good quality of life, and learn effectively. Specific objectives included enhancing environmental control. educating staff, clarifying medication protocols, and responding appropriately to symptoms. Strategies in developing the policy included strengthening collaboration and network among health, school. and community sectors: defining the role of the school and health sectors: designing the policy: refining the policy based on stakeholder feedback: and developing an evaluation plan.

SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The role and importance of street-level bureaucrats in policy implementation is now widely recognised. So far as the EU's agri-environmental policy is concerned, however, a focus on the attitudes and behaviour of programme recipients (farmers and other land managers) has tended to obscure the role of street-level bureaucrats responsible for extending and advising on schemes and the impact of their interpretive frameworks and communication practices on policy outcomes. This paper draws on interviews with extensionists and advisers in England and Finland in order to explore the different interpretations, which these actors bring to the implementation of agri-environmental policy and to reflect on the implications of this for the way environmental advice is currently being offered to farmers within the agri-environmental network.

ID BEHAVIORS
AB Many parallels can be drawn between cigarettes and motor vehicles, smoking and car driving, and the tobacco and the auto/oil industries. Those promoting healthy and sustainable transport policies can learn lessons from tobacco control activities over the past 50 years. Evidence-based legislation is more effective than negotiated voluntary agreements between industry and government. Media advocacy is crucial to reframe the issues to allow changes in national policies that facilitate healthier choices. Worthwhile public health policies seen as a threat by multinational companies will be opposed by them but active national and international networks of healthcare professionals, voluntary organizations, charities and their supporters can match the political power of these industries.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE environmental indices; multicriterion evaluation; decision-making;
   irrigation management; composite programming; sustainable development
AB Irrigation management calls for objective criteria capable of representing the economy, reliability, and productivity of irrigation systems, These criteria must be compatible with long-term sustainability and conservation goals. The criteria representing the above goals are the economic effect of management on yield reduction, economic effect, and reliability referring to plant growth and operation of the network. In this study environmental indices are introduced to express the above criteria in quantitative terms. The inclusion of these indices at the farm and network level create a multicriteria framework for decision-making based on composite programming. An experimental study was conducted during the irrigation periods of 1989 and 1990 in Chania, Greece, concerning water delivered to 40 experimental plots, soil moisture content at the rootzone, and irrigation system operational failures. The data collected in real time were used for the calculation of the corresponding environmental indices. The variation in time and space is high and resulted in up to 62% of yield loss and low system performance (up to 7% of system temporal reliability). The study indicated that environmental indices could be incorporated to select alternatives and also to develop policies on water delivery. The final decision involves a trade-off analysis between cost of application and desired system performance. Measures of both primary, objectives can be obtained using environmental indices that re present system operation aggregation at its basic levels (on farm and network).

TI Application-level control of IP networks: IP beyond the internet
SO BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Internet today can be compared to a road system that is freely accessible to everyone with a car. Traffic jams are the inevitable consequence. Traditional switched telephone networks, on the other hand, can be compared to railways, which have limited access to tracks, resold (or even reserved) seats, and limited or nonexistent traffic jams. Delays and cost are predictable. The Internet, with its increasing importance for telecommunications and business, can no longer afford unpredictable traffic jams. The convergence of voice and data on a single packet-based network imposes stringent requirements for quality of service (QoS) stability, billing, and security. Therefore, the Internet must conform to basic rules that govern traditional telecommunication infrastructures as well as accommodate new, flexible business models beyond the present free-for-all that address regional market differentiation and local regulation. This paper describes a network architecture that allows today's Internet to evolve in a way that permits more flexible business models and differentiated policies. Networks are modeled as separate domains, each with its own set of transport services, policies, and QoS mechanisms within an autonomous business framework. This architecture combines elements of both telecommunication and data networks: it is Internet protocol (IP) based but without the business constraints imposed by the Internet today.

ID ACTIVITY PATTERNS
AB Ethnic minority and low-income populations have the highest rates of cardiovascular disease and the lowest rates of leisure-time physical activity. Because physical activity reduces the risk of premature death and disability from cardiovascular disease, researching correlates to such activity in these populations is an important aspect of health promotion in the US. To identify environmental, policy, and cultural barriers to physical activity in women, The Women's Cardiovascular Health Network Project conducted focus groups with White, African American, Latina, and American Indian women aged 20-50 years. The focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed with QSR NUD*IST qualitative software using a set of codes developed a priori by the research team. Family priorities were a main barrier to physical activity in all the groups. Having multiple roles as wife, mother, daughter, and as an active community member was mentioned as time-consuming and difficult, leaving little time or energy for exercise. Cultural barriers, which varied among the groups, included acculturation issues, lack of community support, and lack of past experience with exercise. Physical activity interventions suggested involved work programs, family-friendly programs, increased social support, and the availability of safer places to exercise such as parks, well-lit walking trails, and recreation centers. Many of the barriers were common to all groups (e.g., family priority) while some were unique (e.g., lack of community support). Assessing and addressing the issues raised should be considered when planning physical activity interventions for these populations. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Consolidating a neoliberal policy bloc in Canada, 1976 to 1996
SO CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY-ANALYSE DE POLITIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID CORPORATE
AB This paper charts the development of a neoliberal policy bloc in Canada by considering five sites of business activism: two organizations with roots in the 1950s, which more or less embraced neoliberal projects in the 1980s; two that emerged in the 1970s; and one that was formed in 1994. Our investigation focuses on how these groups contributed to the consolidation of neoliberal hegemony in Canadian public policy. To that end, we present comparative case studies of the five groups (their ideological trajectories and their contemporary niches within an organizational ecology of neoliberal policy formation) and a network analysis of the positions they have taken up in the web of interlocking corporate directorates. Some political implications in the current era are discussed.

LA English
DT Article
AB Cleaner technology and pollution prevention have been cornerstones in the Danish environmental policy since the late 1980's. They have become an integral part of the multifaceted process of the 'greening of industry' involving changes in production, products and in the environmental strategies of companies, as well as in governmental regulation and policies. Companies, industrial associations, consultants and different governmental bodies have established new relations and networks to support the greening process and gradually innovations as well as economic and environmental issues in new ways. Based on several evaluations of Danish governmental support schemes for the introduction of cleaner technology and environmental management, this article will outline the major changes in the discourse on pollution prevention and in the policy instruments applied.

AB Transshipment facilities are nodes on a network where a change occurs between modes of travel or between transportation networks. Their location is important in the competitiveness of multimodal transport. The aim of this paper is to discuss this type of location in the scope of location theory. The location of the transshipment facilities between networks is here defined as a discrete problem that locates facilities (technical equipments) enabling the transfer from one transportation network to another, and minimising total transportation costs. A mathematical formulation of the problem is proposed and discussed: it relies on integer linear programming. This formulation is quite flexible and enables several extensions that can be combined in order to represent several real-world planning situations.

AB The widespread use of inland waterways as a common transport mode is a main objective of European traffic policy, specifically in view of the expected dramatic increase in transport along the Trans-European Network, a main economic lifeline in Europe. Transport operators' limited acceptance of the inland waterway reflects unreliable calculations of estimated time of arrival, shifting water levels or other environmental events, unexpected delays in passing locks and borders, and insufficient transport monitoring capability. Implementing a telematics-based river information service will help to alleviate waterway transportation problems on the Danube River early in the day and improve the safety and productivity of transportation by integrating river-based transport information services with the intermodal transport chain. The proposed system meets the requirements of the Supreme Shipping Authority of Austria to generate a tactical and strategic traffic image on the Danube in Austria to fulfill its legal commitments to ensure safe and secure transport operations on the Danube. Communications interfaces will link the Austrian network connecting other users downstream as well (e.g., Hungary, Slovakia). Traffic information services will be provided to ship operators, ship owners, and transport operators carrying people and goods. The system consists of a transponder-based network using radio links embedded in a wire-based communications network on shore controlled by central management facilities providing tactical traffic information on a geographic-information-system-based application. A separate system and network management unit will ensure safe operations with a low failure rate, depending on the level of redundancy implemented. The overall system concept uses the results and provisional standards defined in the European Union project Inland Navigation Demonstrator for River Information Services. The basic functionality of the system was demonstrated in a field trial near Hinesburg, Austria, in mid-April 1999, and in Grain, Austria, in November 1999. The main system will be developed in a test center in Vienna during 2001 and 2002.

AB The Internet has evolved from a traditional best-effort delivery data network into an enhanced Internet that can provide a certain Quality of Service(QoS) mechanisms for applications. However, these QoS mechanisms usually do not take policy factors into account such as priority and time-of-day. The paper presents a Resource Management Framework for Policy-driven QoS control (PRM) in enhanced internets, which consists of four components: Domain Policy Controller(DPC) resides an administrator domain, Border Resource Manager(BRM) resides between adjacent domains, Interior Resource Managers(IRM) in each router between two BRMs within the same domain, and Endsystem Resource Manager(ERM) in charge of end-node/host router resources. We first introduce challenges and demands facing the enhanced internets: then give a formalized definition of policy and describe the functions and interaction of components of PRM. Specifically we take QoS-pricing policy used in a Diff-Serv environment as an example to illustrate the operational phases of PRM.

ID RESTRUCTURING SCHOOLS; INSTRUCTIONAL POLICY; REFORM; CLASSROOM; DISTRICT
AB Recent research on the relationship between instructional policy and classroom practice suggests that teachers interpret, adapt, and even transform policies as they put them into place. This paper extends this line of research, using an in-depth case study of one California elementary school to examine the processes by which teachers construct and reconstruct multiple policy messages about reading instruction in the context of their professional communities. Drawing primarily on institutional and sensemaking theory, this paper puts forth a model of collective sensemaking that focuses on the ways teachers co-construct understandings of policy messages, make decisions about which messages to pursue in their classrooms, and negotiate the technical and practical details of implementation in conversations with their colleagues. It also argues that the nature and structure of formal networks and informal alliances among teachers shape the process, with implications for ways in which messages from the policy environment influence classroom practice. Finally, the paper explores the role school leaders play in shaping the sensemaking process.

AB Underwater observatories with real-time data and virtually unlimited power transmission capabilities compared to traditional oceanographic moorings are beginning to provide scientists with continuous access to the coastal and open ocean. However, for any coastal observatory to serve as a cost-effective system for the collection of long-term scientific and environmental data, it must have a simple, upgradeable power and telemetry system and an instrument interface that is compatible with existing standards. It must be designed for extended environmental exposure and ease of service to avoid high maintenance costs. Most importantly, the observatory must be accessible to all potential users, including students, scientists, engineers, and policy makers. This strategy was applied to the design of the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory on the south shore of the island of Martha's Vineyard. The new facility, and in particular its system architecture, as developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with support from the National Science Foundation, are described.

AB Mobile computing is a domain in great expansion. Wireless networks (GSM, satellite, etc) and Portable Information Appliances PIAs (laptops, PDAS, cellular phones, etc) are developing very rapidly. More and more mobile users would like to execute their applications with the same quality of service as on their desktop station, whatever their needs in memory and computing power Using such applications in a mobile environment raises new challenges. Some of these applications are extremely costly in system and network resources, whereas PIAS resources are poor and wireless networks offer a very variable quality of connection. In this paper we propose an adaptive and dynamic distribution of applications on the local environment to overcome the poorness of available resources on PIAS, and to reduce and regulate variability effects. Moreover due to the variety of distribution policies, we propose a framework providing adaptive distribution policies.

AB This article examines how sexual harassment has been conceptualized by French feminists in an increasingly global political environment, demonstrating how feminist ideas, politics and legal initiatives are transformed as they travel across space and time. I argue that feminist networks have been a central determinant of the ways in which ideas about sexual harassment have spread across the globe in the past 20 years. However, I further contend that there were basic national differences in political, legal and cultural traditions that made it likely that feminist concepts and policies would be translated as they traveled. Moreover, I show how certain social actors heightened the importance of such cultural differences through 'symbolic boundary work'. Finally, I discuss how feminist activists both distance themselves from negative stereotypes of American feminist approaches to sexual harassment and simultaneously draw on international networks and ideas to expand the scope of French sexual harassment law.

AB What states can and cannot do under conditions of globalization remains an important question in current studies of public policy. Some stress that states are increasingly limited in the types of policies they can deploy, while others argue that states remain active and important players, but in different ways. This article argues that 'transformative capacity' rooted in links between the state and societal actors will be crucial for determining what options are available to governments. This argument is addressed by examining the evolution of agricultural structural policy in France over the past forty years. Globalization, regional economic integration, as well as environmental and social issues posed new challenges for policy-makers in agriculture beginning in the early 1980s, forcing a reconstitution of state-society relations, first vertically and then horizontally, as a basis for transformative capacity. In the process, the state has shifted from a reliance on rather closed bipartite corporatist policy networks to more open multipartite corporatism. These reconstructed relations with the agri-food sector are now permitting the French state to pursue a new approach to agricultural structural policy that adjusts to globalization on its own terms.

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE

DT Article
AB An ad hoc network must operate independent of a preestablished or centralized network management infrastructure, while still providing administrative services needed to support applications. Address allocation, name resolution, service location, authentication, and access control policies represent just some of the functionality that must be supported - without preconfiguration or centralized services. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to leverage some aspect of the environment in which the network operates. We introduce the notion of a spontaneous network, created when a group of people come together for some collaborative activity. In this case, we can use the human interactions associated with the activity in order to establish a basic service and security infrastructure. We structure our discussion around a practical real-world scenario illustrating the use of such a network, identifying the key challenges involved and some of the techniques that can be used to address them.

TI Corporate governance of road construction in Brunei Darussalam
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
DE environment; quality control; roads & highways
AB Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not mandatory before starting any major road construction or infrastructure development in Brunei Darussalam. Nevertheless, some variations of impact assessment have been conducted as part of the feasibility studies for many of these projects. Such an obligation would encourage most consultants to focus on the merits and problems of the physical state of the environment. Their clients would then be led to examine and adopt the various engineering solutions along with the financial implications as laid out by the consultants. Assessment and preparation for socio-economic changes are often sidelined. Planning for modern transportation cannot afford to ignore the whole spectrum of the environmental impact. The selection of a road or its network is more often influenced by the human landscape and the change in environmental quality than by factors related to landform, earthwork and slope stability. During the construction and operation stages, the impact generally consists of a mixture of positive and negative components. The latter can then be made worse by poor quality in design, construction and maintenance. This paper draws a conceptual approach to the development of good corporate governance for key organisations (clients, consultants, contractors and suppliers) amidst the existing economic landscape and construction practices. All relevant organisations should ideally embrace the concept of an integrated Health, Safety, Environmental and Quality (HSEQ) system to deliver good governance. This structural change will enable all 'key players' to deliver solutions that match the benefits derived from traditional forms of EIA and quality assurance (QA). The paper attempts to embed the two obligatory functions, namely the QA and the EIA, into the self-regulatory, responsible, and competitive culture found among clients, consultants, contractors and suppliers in the road industry in Brunei Darussalam.

TI Emerging patterns of complex technological innovation
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE technology; innovation; complexity; policy; networks
ID TACIT KNOWLEDGE; BUSINESS
AB Technological innovation is increasingly concerned with complex products and processes. The trend toward greater complexity is suggested by the fact that in 1970 complex technologies comprised 43% of the 30 most valuable world goods exports, but by 1996 complex technologies represented 84% of those goods. These technologies are innovated by self-organizing networks. Networks are those linked organizations that create, acquire, and integrate the diverse knowledge and skills required to innovate complex technologies. Accessing tacit knowledge (i.e., experienced-based, unwritten know-how) and integrating it with codified knowledge is a particular strength of many networks. Self-organization refers to the capacity networks have for reordering themselves into more complex structures (e.g., replacing individual managers with management teams), and for using more complex processes (e.g., evolving strategies) without centralized, detailed managerial guidance. Case studies of the innovation pathways traced by six complex technologies indicate that innovations can be grouped into three quite distinct patterns. Transformation: the launching of a new trajectory by a new coevolving network and technology. Normal: the coevolution of an established network and technology along an established trajectory. Transition: the coevolutionary movement to a new trajectory by an established network and technology. Policy makers and managers face the greatest challenge during those periods of movement from one innovation trajectory to another. These are periods of turbulence; they are the embodiment of Schumpeter's "gales of creative destruction." This paper investigates how, in six case studies, core capabilities, complementary assets, organizational learning, path dependencies, and the selection environment varied among the innovation patterns. The paper builds on work reported in a recent book by the authors entitled: The Complexity Challenge: Technological Innovation for the 21st Century, Pinter, London, 1999.

DE social impact; traffic engineering; transport planning
AB Transport policy in the UK has been the focus of much deliberation and reformulation in recent years. While a ten year E 180 billion spending plan is now in place this does not, nor should it, preclude the ongoing debate over transport's future and the principles with which it should be shaped. This paper presents a set of such principles which has been produced by the Transport Visions Network. The Network is a virtual community of some 250 young professionals that is exploring the future of transport in the twenty-first century. Having taken a long-term view in its deliberations, the Network has conceived twelve principles relating to the topics of. accessibility; mobility; costs; environment; trip type; health and safety; electronic communication; land use; reliability; social participation; stakeholders; and information.

AB As mobile networking is moving towards the direction of providing high-speed multimedia services, the presence of connections that do not generate traffic at constant rate is becoming reality in wireless environment. For preliminary network design purposes analytical models are necessary that examine the performance or wireless networks with such connections, In this paper an analytical method is presented to calculate call-level system parameters of cellular networks with multimedia connections. The method is based on an approximate recursive calculation. The accuracy of the approximation is verified by computer simulations. The derivation of the distributions of user describing time variables and two simple admission control policies are also presented and investigated.

   China: stages and characteristic indices
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy policy; energy consumption; energy planning
AB This paper discusses history variance and general features on rural household energy consumption with the economic development in China. Energy shortage has been a long-standing problem in rural areas of China. The average effective energy consumption was 0.46-0.54 kgce per day per household in the 1960s and 1970s. The reason for this is that the rural household energy supply mainly relies on the available amounts of local natural energy resources. The problem of cooking fuel shortage was basically solved in the early 1980s since more straw and stalks were produced due to the rapid development of agriculture. The process of energy commercialization also started from the early 1980s due to the availability of coal, fuel oil and other energy sources in the market, and the reconstruction of rural power supply network. Energy consumption was 369.8kgce per capita with 30% of commercial energy consumption and the effective heat per capita per day was 0.64kgce in 1995. A closer relationship was found between household energy consumption level/structure and family income along with the economic development. This paper analyzed the rural household energy consumption of three typical regions, i.e., out-of-poverty, well-off and rich regions, in terms of effective heat per capita per day, percentage of commercial energy consumption in total effective heat, electricity consumption per capita and room temperature of northern areas in winter.

ID DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; DECISION-MAKING; MAIN; RELIABILITY; MODEL
AB In the actual operation of a distribution network, failure can occur in any component of the network, such as pumps, valves, junctions, and pipes. When a component is experiencing failure, the question raised is whether to replace or repair it. For the case of a pipe in the distribution network, which is one of the most frequently subject-to-failure components, there are some aspects that still remain unresolved in relation to practical operations of a maintenance program. In this research paper, a mathematical model is developed which aims to support a decision to repair or replace a main pipe in the state of failure. The objective of the model is to maximize the long-run availability of the pipe under some budget constraints. A semi-Markov process is used to depict the behavior of the pipe, and replacement ages of the pipe in each of its deteriorating stages are taken as the decision variables. The original nonlinear problem resulting from model formulation is converted to a linear problem by some simple transformations, and then numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model.

AB The National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), organized within the Ministry of Health (MoH), is an essential component for the planning, execution and coordination of malaria control activities. As effective case management remains the mainstay of malaria control in almost every African country, antimalarial drug resistance is a major barrier to the implementation of effective malaria control policies. In order to function effectively, these units must have an efficient surveillance system which can provide reliable and current estimates of the severity of drug resistance. Without this information, it is impossible for the Mol-l to design and promote a rational antimalarial policy, but because of limited resources, especially of people and expertise, most NMCPs have been unable to initiate and manage such a system. The need for collaborative partnerships between the MoH and the research community prompted the establishment of the East Africa Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment (EANMAT). EANMAT has attempted to bring together the complimentary skills-of malaria researchers and MoH staff in four east African countries. After 3 years of operation, data generated by EANMAT have been used to review and modify national malaria treatment policies in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. This new approach, which forges a closer working relationship between the research and policy communities, has effectively built capacity around the complex of surveillance, interpretation and use of evidence within a policy environment. The added-value of this approach is that the research community has learned to appreciate the constraints of policy development, and that the control community has established the need to build capacity and ownership of research evidence. Networks similar to EANMAT should be encouraged elsewhere in Africa to engender similar partnerships: to assist the development of rational treatment policies, and thus more effective malaria chemotherapy leading to significant lowering of malaria morbidity and mortality.

TI Environmental innovations in small and medium sized enterprises
SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Supporting and accelerating the adoption and diffusion of environmental innovations amongst small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is a major challenge to environmental policy makers. Research suggests that whilst SMEs possess high flexibility, their innovative capacity may be limited to incremental changes within their existing technology system and network. Twenty case studies examining the innovation adoption process in SMEs in four sectors and in five countries within the ENVIS project' (commissioned by the EU) revealed great variety in factors driving this process. Findings indicate that this variation can be attributed to the character of the environmental innovation, the speck business opportunity, the regulatory setting and pressure experienced by the sector. Based on these findings an analytical framework is suggested, whereby the environmental innovative capability of SMEs is conceived as the result of an interplay between the competencies, the network relations and the strategic orientation of the company (the 'dynamic triangle'). This indicates that policy to support SME's adoption of environmental innovations has to take an integrated form, i.e. addressing and developing competence, networks and strategic orientation of SMEs simultaneously whilst remaining systemic and context sensitive.

AB Increasingly, non-human geographies have unfastened nature from its foundational moorings. In a parallel development, the benefits of adhering to precautionary and participatory forms of decision-making have become common place in environmental geography and in government policy. And yet, on closer inspection, there is a danger in these latter approaches that old certainties regarding non-human natures remain unquestioned. The result can be a tendency to gravitate towards bureaucratic and technical solutions to, or closures on, what are, first and foremost, political and open-ended problems. This paper uses an empirical engagement with BSE-related scientific and policy practices, along with insights from lion-human geographies, science studies and poststructuralism to suggest that such certainties and resolutions are misplaced.

TI Bandwidth allocation for the transmission of scalable MPEG video traffic

AB This paper studies bandwidth allocation schemes for the transmission of VBR video traffic with deterministic guarantees, i.e., no packets lossed and no missed deadlines. Specifically, we propose and investigate a policy named quasi-constant policy. A VBR encoder attempts to keep the quality of video output constant by varying the transmission rate (constant quality); on the other hand, with a quasi-constant policy the video quality transmission is reduced when congestion occurs. We assume that this reduction is obtained by exploiting source scalability. By characterizing the traffic of a source with a constraint function, we define the relationship between the amount of bandwidth assigned to a VER source and the maximum delay the application may experience. By applying this relationship to long MPEG 2 traces (more than one hour) we show that the quasi-constant policy is a very promising direction for providing, in an efficient way, a deterministic QoS to VER video traffic. Specifically, the results presented indicate that with the quasi-constant quality approach we can achieve a utilization greater than 50% with a deadline of one second with only eight reduced-quality frames out of 1000. On the other hand, previous works ([1, 2]) indicate that with a constant quality transmission, a 50% network utilization can be achieved only by tolerating a seven-second deadline.

AB This article examines the diffusion of a novel governance structure, the so-called partner-associate structure, among a population of Dutch professional services firms during the period 1925-90. An institutional change emerged out of an interaction between selection at the level of sector and imitative adoption at the firm level. We argue that market feedback regarding the novel structure fostered its legitimacy. Furthermore, the effect of market feedback is conditional upon three diffusion filters: social networks, propinquity, and strategic group membership. Diffusion as a legitimization process unfolds, therefore, at both the sectoral and the firm level of analysis.

AB Forest certification is an indirect economic incentive for improved forest management. Originating in the early 1990s, and supported by environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), forest certification has become one of the more controversial topics in forest policy discussions, and the real benefits it provides to forest owners and managers have been questioned. Under these circumstances, the rapid spread of certification has been subject to divergent interpretations. In this article, the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), an actor-based analytical framework developed by Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith in the US, is used to analyse the development of forest certification systems in Canada, Indonesia and Sweden. The ACF provides a convincing framework for this analysis, particularly when it is complemented with elements from the policy network approach and the concept of epistemic communities. Support is provided for several of the key hypotheses of the ACF, and a number of proposals for modifications to the ACF are made. Based on the example of forest certification, it is argued that the ACF can be a useful tool for understanding policy processes with multiple actors and involving policy learning.

AB We study the opportunities to increase the use of wood in the Dutch residential construction sector and assess the effects on material related CO2 emission. Four house types are modeled with increasing quantities of wood used in constructions. CO2 emission reductions of almost 50% are technically possible. We assess the innovation characteristics of these wood applications to create insights in the complexity of the necessary change process. Then we relate the innovation characteristics of the wood options to the context in which implementation of the technologies take place. The options vary strongly in the required technical and network changes and so do the opportunities to implement them. Based on this we expect that a 12% CO2 emission reduction related to material use for residential buildings is possible in the short term by an increased share of wood use. We also study the possibilities for increased wood recycling practices. A large technical potential exists. To achieve this potential a significant policy effort is needed since significant changes in both technical and network dimensions are necessary. To stimulate innovation in the use of wood in residential construction, important focus points of policy making should be the culture in the Dutch construction sector, the way new building projects are commissioned, research areas within the building sector, and stabilization of building networks.

ID DESIGN
AB Automatic provisioning and recovery of lightpaths with selectable traffic engineering policies are considered basic features of near future optical transport networks (OTN). Worldwide researchers recognize generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) architecture as the viable control plane solution to achieve these issues in OTN.
   Growing effort is ongoing to find new recovery models for handling failure conditions in the networks, trying to set up alternative strategies to classical heavy-cost SDH/SONET protection techniques. In this paper, a pre-planned local repair recovery strategy is described. Allocation of primary paths is provided using the interference concept, in order to set a threshold between resources dedicated to working paths and those allocable for local backups in case of failure. Tests of the strategy are shown for a sample national optical transport network, aimed at valuing local-repair recovery times at different failure location and seriousness.

AB To gain insight into the potential logistical benefits of worker cross-training and agile workforce policies, we study simple models of flexible workers in serial production systems. The primary control issue is how to assign workers to jobs/stations over time. Under assumptions of complete worker flexibility and collaborative work, we prove that a simple expedite policy minimizes along each sample path the cycle time (delay) for each job. Therefore, the expedite policy also minimizes work in process and maximizes throughput along every sample path. We also compute the performance improvement opportunity achievable using flexible workers as opposed to the optimal static allocation of workers. This enables us to examine the factors that make workforce agility a potentially attractive strategy. We also consider the intuitive analog of the expedite policy for the noncollaborative work environment, which we call the pick-and-run policy; however, we demonstrate by counterexample that it is not always optimal. Finally, we extend some of our insights from the demand-constrained environment to a capacity-constrained environment operating under a CONstant WIP (CONWIP) protocol.

ID PEAK
AB This paper considers the second-best problem where not all links of a congested transportation network can be tolled. This paper builds on earlier work, in which the second-best tax rule for this problem was derived for general static networks, so that the solution presented is valid for any graph of the network, and for any set of tolling points available on that network. An algorithm is presented for finding second-best tolls, based on this general solution. A simulation model is used for studying its performance for various archetype pricing schemes: a toll-cordon, area licences, parking policies in the city centre, pricing of a single major highway, and pay-lanes and 'free-lanes' on major highways. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis is given of a method for selecting the optimal location of toll points when not all links can be tolled. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assess the empirical relevance of the new theory of regulation, using a principal-agent framework to study the regulatory schemes used in the French urban, transport industry. Taking the current regulatory schemes as given, the model of supply and demand provides estimates for the firms' inefficiency, the effort of managers, and the cost of public funds. It allows us to derive the first-best and second-best regulatory policies for each network and compare them with the actual situation in terms of welfare loss or gain. Fixed-price policies lie between fully informed and uninformed second-best schemes. Cost-plus contracts are dominated by any type of second-best contract. From these results, we may conjecture that fixed-price contracts call for better-informed regulators.

TI Institutional framework in the period before Slovakia's European Union
   accession
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS

DT Article
AB Adequate institutional structure is a precondition for EU membership. As the reference date for accession is 2004, all relevant acquis should be implemented until the end of this year and so is expected adequate strengthening of capacities. In the accession process framework are specified another priorities (e.g. harmonization of legal system), measures for implementation and conditions for providing support. However, adaptation depends also on transparency of decision-making, law enforcement and elimination of corruption. Reform of public administration, made through decentralization, is based on operation of state administration and regional self-government and on changing competencies with the aim to reduce expenditures and improve services. Respected in this process are principles of subsidiarity and competitive environment.
   In general, there has been a strengthening of the system of governmental management bodies like, e.g., Custom directorate of the Slovak republic. In the case of public finance the gradual reductions of subsidies is the basic principle to be followed in the next future and market functioning should be improved via financial control over enterprises. Economic policy priorities have shifted from liberalization and privatization towards structural changes in corporate law. The amendment should increase transparency of ownership and business relations and, therefore, lead to a better corporate governance. Mentioned briefly are survey results on increasing ownership concentration of the biggest shareholders. Among central issues is also formation of competitive environment. Following acts on state assistance and on protection of economic competition, expected is approval of legal regulations allowing to provide group exceptions from prohibition of agreements limiting competition for certain agreements.
   Despite the fact that, as mentioned above, the state enforces liberal model of the economy based on transparency of business environment it also aims to develop some industries or branches to make Slovak industrial structure more similar to that of EU countries. Such changes should lead towards higher intra-industry trade, a feature typical for developed economics. Accepted concept of state science and technology policy, supporting participation in EU framework programs, faces problem with inadequate funding.
   In corporate law an amended bankruptcy act has enforced position of creditors which should speed-up corporate restructuring and recovery. Being aware of the positive role of foreign investment, the state promotes their inflows using certain policy measures like tax holiday etc. As a potential positive by-product of ending privatization is considered the possibility that completion of privatization could eliminate chances for corruption in state administration.
   Some changes have indirect impact on corporate costs or production. Poorly performing healthcare sector increases illness rates of workforce and problems in education sector negatively affects qualification of labor force. It is necessary, according to policymakers, to reform social system by changing the system of pension and social insurance and social aid. Reform of healthcare should guarantee transition towards predominantly ambulant form of care and decentralization of the whole system. Elementary healthcare insurance should be extended by supplementary insurance and optional commercial insurance schemes.
   In environmental protection the main principles are those related to sustainable development. National environmental action program SR II has originated and the realization of this policy is conditioned by introduction of environmental taxes, management and audit. Projected are also monitoring and information systems. Key role in the process of EU programs and implemented should be the administrative structure at NUTS 11 level. Improvement of technical preparation of projects financed from EU structural funds is needed.
   In the area of free movement of goods it is necessary implement operational directives related to technical requirements for products. Act oil public procurement has already been implemented to a substantial degree acquis but real use has remained a problem. Legal changes should be followed by building of administrative capacities. One example is the need for coordination of the control of adjustment process in the area of Slovak technical norms in non-harmonized area.
   As general requirement, it is necessary to implement numerous laws in individual chapters in the whole EU directives agenda. Labor Code and laws oil state and public services, in the chapter of social policy and employment, were implemented recently but the remaining problem is flexibility, of labor market. Approval of the law oil network industries regulation, creation of regulatory office and removal of price distortions had prepared conditions for successful restructuring of energy industry. Passed was the law on emergency petrol reserves and petrol products and amended was the law oil state tangible reserves. Enforced will be the capacity of the Off ice for regulation of network industries due to the preparation of secondary legislature in this area. In a preliminary concluded chapter Protection of consumer and health remaining directives should be implemented, c. g., marking of consumer products with price tags.. and legislature regulating market supervision. Passed was also a custom act. full harmonized should be the scheme of General systcru of preferences (until 2004) and passcd should be all act on Export-import Bank of the SR. In preparatory stage is a new information society strategy.
   Progress in transposition of accession chapters is the subject of EC evaluations. Report on Preparedness (2001) positively evaluates number of measures already made. It states that progress has been reached in the areas of structure and functioning of administration, justice, legislature of internal market, corporate law and competition. Progress has to be made in agriculture sector and in enforcing of administrative capacities (e. g., management and control of EC funds). Improvement has been expected especially in the area of corporate law, competition, social policy and employment. Comparison of candidate countries made on the basis,of convergence indicator DCEI (DGZ Deka Bank) shows that the Slovak republic still lacks behind other candidate partners. However, in the area of institutional convergence is its evaluation better than is the total country rating. Evaluations have informative purpose only but for accession decisions one should look also oil non-economic (political and strategic) dimensions.

AB With the rising popularity of the Internet there have arisen corresponding requirements for network reliability, efficiency, and service quality. Internet service providers are responding to these developments by critically examining every aspect of their operational environment, looking for opportunities to scale their networks and optimize performance. In this context, traffic engineering has emerged as a major consideration in the design and operation of large public Internet backbone networks. However, the classical Internet interior gateway routing protocols hinder the practical realization of sophisticated traffic engineering policies in legacy IP networks. The advent of multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) offers the prospect to address some of the shortcomings associated with traffic engineering in IP networks. This paper discusses the techniques and practices of traffic engineering in contemporary IP networks, emphasizing the role of MPLS in performance optimization of the public Internet. We also examine the impact of generalized MPLS (GMPLS) on traffic engineering in IP-over-optical networks as the underlying technologies continue to mature.

ID OPTIMAL ROAD CAPACITY; EFFICIENCY; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; TOLLS
AB This paper studies the second-best problem where not all links of a congested transportation network can be tolled. The second-best tax rule for this problem is derived for general static networks, so that the solution presented is valid for any graph of the network and any set of tolling points available. A number of known second-best tax rules are shown to be special cases of the general solution presented. It is further demonstrated that, for instance by using the concept of `virtual links', the same method can be applied to a broader class of second-best problems in static networks. Finally, a small network is used to demonstrate numerically that an interior second-best optimum need not always be unique, and need not always exist. However, both examples require extreme differences in marginal external costs across links, and a non-optimal toll-point to be used, which casts doubt on the practical relevance of this complication.

TI On the efficacy of quality, frame rate, and buffer management for video
   streaming across best-effort networks
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH SPEED NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we propose a mechanism that supports the high quality streaming and adaptation of stored, constant-quality video across best-effort networks. The difficulty in the delivery of such traffic over best-effort networks is the fact that both the bandwidth required from the stream and the bandwidth available across the network vary considerably over time. Our proposed approach has a number of useful features. First, it uses the a priori information from the video stream to drive, that adaptation policy. Second, it does not rely on any special handling or support from the network itself, although any additional support from the network will indirectly help increase the video quality. Third, it can be built on top of TCP, which effectively separates the adaptation and streaming from the transport protocol. This makes the question of TCP-friendliness much easier to answer. Using actual MPEG encoded video data at multiple qualities, we show through experimentation that this approach provides a viable alternative for streaming media: across best-effort networks.

AB The authors analyzes the transport. infrastructure of the Balkan region. Even though the Balkans are an important crossroads for European trade with other parts of the world, Balkan regional transportation networks are both underdeveloped and poorly oriented to the region's need to expand its trade with the European Union (EU) and other parts of the world. The article examines both the needed regional policies for improving the transportation network and how regional efforts fit into the broader all-European programs, such as those of the EU, for improving transport in the region.

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Local Agenda 21 (LA21) processes have 2 central goals. i) On the basis of some of the empirical evidence in this study, the primary goal is to improve democratic (environmental) policy-making processes in such a manner that a larger share of the population will be able to participate in planning and decision making and will also be able to understand the consequences of these decisions. ii) The LA21 processes seek to improve (at least indirectly) the broadly defined environmental situation locally in a manner that takes into account both the local and the i global contexts. The first part of this article discusses the concept and methods of LA21 and sheds light on the different action areas that are central to the Baltic LA21 processes. In addition, the study will describe and display the LA21 situation within one network of cities, the Union of the Baltic Cities (UBC). Networking, including transfer of information, models and ideas, has been among the main tools for the diffusion of LA21 ideas especially into newly democratized societies. Finally, the article will conclude with an overall assessment of the LA21 situation on the Baltic rim.

AB The needs of modern societies, coupled with the ever increasing power of technology. encourage the development of systems of enormous complexity. Examples are contemporary infrastructures such as transportation, energy, and information, often described as 'systems of systems' Coping with such complexity is a central problem for their architects and operators. Complex systems behave in unanticipated ways and they have failed spectacularly. The factors influencing system failure go beyond the purely technical, to matters of organization, management, operations, training, regulation, and market incentives, all concerns of the engineering profession. Failures often result from subtle combinations of such factors. public policy has been directed to the vulnerabilities of national infrastructures, especially as they, can be disrupted by both inadvertant failure and malicious attack. If engineers are to increase dic robustness of, the systems they design and operate, they must recognize the phenomenon of emergent properties rooted in the scale and 'depth' of the system. The Internet. while an operational infrastructure, is also capable of supporting experimentation without the knowledge of or interference with, its users. Harvey Mudd College's CS 125 course, Computer Networking, covers principles and practices of computer networking. The cont-se has a significant project component that relics on the Internet as an experimental facility. Oversight of such educational and research activities is required if network performance is not to be degraded or user privacy violated. Several examples are presented An appreciation of emergent properties of systems should be a baccalaureate-level goal, not simply for computer science curricula, bw for all of systems engineering.

TI Coerciveness and the selection of environmental policy instruments
SO CANADIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DU CANADA
LA English
DT Article
AB Degree of coerciveness is often used to categorize policy instruments. This article analyses the relative coerciveness associated with the instruments used by municipal, provincial and federal governments in Canada to address three major successive pollution threats-sewage, industrial toxic waste, and greenhouse-gas emissions-that have appeared on the policy agenda over the course of the past century. During that time, there has been an overall trend of declining coerciveness, with one exception. In the case of toxic waste, established regulatory regimes were made more coercive some years after they were first put in place. These findings can best be explained by theories of instrument choice that look to interactions among relevant state and societal actors in the policy network. It is suggested that one aspect of that process in particular-the balance of power between regulator and "regulatee"-is of importance in explaining relative coerciveness. We must first understand the ability of the regulator to coerce before we can explain the selection of more or less coercive instruments.

DE mobile IP; mobility support; multiple packet delivery methods; multiple
   network interfaces; Mobile Policy Table
AB Fueled by the large number of powerful light-weight portable computers, the expanding availability of wireless networks, and the popularity of the Internet, there is an increasing demand to connect portable computers to the Internet at any time and in any place. However, the dynamic nature of a mobile host's connectivity and its use of multiple network interfaces require more flexible network support than has typically been available for stationary workstations.
   This paper introduces two flow-oriented mechanisms, in the context of Mobile IP [25], to ensure a mobile host's robust and efficient communication with other hosts in a changing environment. One mechanism supports multiple packet delivery methods (such as regular IP or Mobile IP) and adaptively selects the most appropriate one to use according to the characteristics of each traffic flow. The other mechanism enables a mobile host to make use of multiple network interfaces simultaneously and to control the selection of the most desirable network interfaces for both outgoing and incoming packets for different traffic flows. We demonstrate the usefulness of these two network layer mechanisms and describe their implementation and performance.

LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; inventory of GHG; mitigation scenarios; GHG emission

AB The energy sector in Lebanon contributes 85% of all CO2 emissions and 96% of all SO2 emissions. In addition, the consumption of electricity in Lebanon is relatively low compared with most industrialized countries, but it is high compared with many developing countries of similar conditions (2200 kW h/capita in 1998). This high electricity intensity suggests that there is a low efficiency in both, the generation and end use. For this reason, two aims have been defined for this paper. The first aim is to develop a baseline scenario that reflects the government policies and plans with regard to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to the electricity sector, and the second aim is to propose mitigation scenarios for reducing GHG emissions in the electricity supply sector. These mitigation scenarios will explore the merits of options not considered by the government to deduce an optimal planning strategy that will lead to a generation expansion plan at minimum cost and minimum emissions. It will be shown that the choice of natural gas as a future fuel is highly recommended and that the promotion of renewable energy technologies is also recommended and should be given priority when these technologies become economically competitive. Other measures such as network loss reduction will positively contribute to GHG mitigation in Lebanon. However, the achievement of such a goal requires no recommendation, as it should be a normal utility practice. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seagrasses cover about 0.1-0.2% of the global ocean, and develop highly productive ecosystems which fulfil a key role in the coastal ecosystem. Widespread seagrass loss results from direct human impacts, including mechanical damage (by dredging, fishing, and anchoring), eutrophication, aquaculture, siltation, effects of coastal constructions, and food web alterations; and indirect human impacts, including negative effects of climate change (erosion by rising sea level, increased storms, increased ultraviolet irradiance), as well as from natural causes, such as cyclones and floods. The present review summarizes such threats and trends and considers likely changes to the 2025 time horizon. Present losses are expected to accelerate, particularly in South-east Asia and the Caribbean, as human pressure on the coastal zone grows. Positive human effects include increased legislation to protect seagrass, increased protection of coastal ecosystems, and enhanced efforts to monitor and restore the marine ecosystem. However, these positive effects are unlikely to balance the negative impacts, which are expected to be particularly prominent in developing tropical regions, where the capacity to implement conservation policies is limited. Uncertainties as to the present loss rate, derived from the paucity of coherent monitoring programmes, and the present inability to formulate reliable predictions as to the future rate of loss, represent a major barrier to the formulation of global conservation policies. Three key actions are needed to ensure the effective conservation of seagrass ecosystems: (1) the development of a coherent worldwide monitoring network, (2) the development of quantitative models predicting the responses of seagrasses to disturbance, and (3) the education of the public on the functions of seagrass meadows and the impacts of human activity.

AB This paper presents a spatial multi-agent programming model, which has been developed for assessing policy options in the diffusion of innovations and resource use changes. Unlike conventional simulation tools used in agricultural economics, the model class described here applies a multi-agent/cellular automata (CA) approach by using heterogeneous farm-household models and capturing their social and spatial interactions explicitly. The individual choice of the farm-household among available production, consumption, investment and marketing alternatives is represented in recursive linear programming models. Adoption constraints are introduced in form of network-threshold values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation of peers' experiences. The model's economic and hydrologic components are tightly connected into a spatial framework. The integration of economic and hydrologic processes facilitates the, consideration of feedback effects in the use of water for irrigation. The simulation runs of the model are carried out with an empirical data set, which has been derived from various data sources on an agricultural region in Chile. Simulation results show that agent-based spatial modelling constitutes a powerful approach to better understanding processes of innovation and resource use change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

TI Bicycle in Shanghai: movement patterns, cyclist attitudes and the impact
   of traffic separation
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
ID CHINA
AB Transportation demand continues to grow at an even faster rate than the economies of Chinese cities, placing increasing pressure on a limited road network. In certain cities of the more highly developed coastal plains, the bicycle assumed a dominant role in urban transport in the 1980s, a position maintained in the 1990s. In Shanghai, the bicycle continues to play a dominant role, although policies favour a switch to public transport. In the present paper, cyclist attitudes toward public transport policies were probed with a pilot questionnaire at two important central destinations. An important example of current policies with regard to bicycles involves the creation of separate networks for motorized and non-motorized modes. A pilot scheme for eventual application over a very large area was recently introduced in the central area. We report on the traffic volumes by mode and street before and after its implementation in 1999. Both bicycle and car volumes diminished in the central area, although the decrease was greater for bicycles. On the other hand, interviewed cyclists expressed resistance to various incentives to use public transport. The question raised here is whether the planned increase in public transport share of total intracity travel can be achieved without disincentives to use the bicycle.

DT Article
AB In this paper we describe an attempt to create an inclusive and participatory information sharing network across a large geographic region, the Gulf of Maine. This network aims to contribute to the health of the region's human and natural environments through facilitating partnerships among individuals and organizations that are already working toward this goal. Initiated at a time when cooperation, public learning, and information sharing increasingly depend on digital information technologies, this effort represents a turn away from earlier attempts to create centralized data sharing systems toward a more people-centered and project-centered approach. After introducing the Gulf of Maine Environmental Information Exchange and its region, particular projects will be described, along with the on-line technologies that are being applied including those related to digital mapping. A description of the purposes of the Information Exchange follows, with details about a network organization which is being shaped based on principles that have emerged through participant interactions. Public participation GIS and the community-based fisheries management movement are presented as examples of participatory governance that have contributed to discussions within the Information Exchange. We conclude with a summary of the accomplishments of this network building process and the challenges its participants recognize at this time.

ID ADMISSION CONTROL
AB This article presents a modeling and simulation methodology to analyze the performance of voice quality when sent over the available bit rate service in asynchronous transfer mode networks. Sources can modify the rate at which they send traffic to the network based on the feedback carried in the resource management cells. This is achieved by changing the encoding level. As the contention increases to network resources-bandwidth in this case-sources start reducing the rate at which they generate and send traffic. The efficiency of the scheme under different scheduling/drop policies and other operating conditions and environments is evaluated using simulation modeling. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is applied to different parameters, such as queue size and averaging interval length, to investigate their impact on the performance metrics. Results show that limiting the load to 41 % of the link capacity results in an acceptable quality.

AB The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

ID AIR-TRAFFIC-CONTROL
AB Ground holding policy (GHP) offers a potential solution to alleviate increasing congestion problems in the air transportation network. The policy proposes to hold an aircraft before takeoff so that when it arrives at its destination. it need not wait in the air before landing. This is motivated by the fact that airborne delays are costlier than ground delays. Many attempts have been made to solve the static GHP problem. However, aspects such as flight cancellations, transfers at hub airports, en route speeding, weather changes, and the interdependent nature of arrival and departure capacities suggest that updating ground holding decisions as time progresses is important. In this paper the dynamic instantaneous GHP problem, considering some of the above aspects, is formulated as an integer programming model. The presence of binary integer variables and discrete variables make the GHP problem complex and computationally difficult to solve using traditional algorithms. As an alternate approach, the use of genetic algorithms is demonstrated and analyzed in this paper. The observed program run time is reasonably small, indicating that genetic algorithms can be used for implementing GHP in real time for dynamic operating environments.

ID ADMISSION CONTROL
AB The huge commercial success of mobile telephony, phenomenal growth of mobile and Internet users, and emerging popularity of IP-based multimedia applications are the major driving forces behind third-generation (3G) evolution. 3G will bring wireline applications, both data and multimedia, into wireless environments. It will operate on IP-based infrastructures to provide wider service access capability. However, current IP is designed for data applications with a single service class, best-effort. Therefore, it is insufficient to support real-time applications that require diverse quality of service (QoS). Although IP can provide greater service flexibility, in terms of spectrum efficiency and QoS, it is not the most appropriate choice in wireless environments. In order to support real-time applications in wireless IP networks, measurement-based admission control (MBAC) is considered. We consider two admission criteria, reservation and priority. The system performance is measured in terms of new call blocking and hand-off call dropping probabilities with three different levels of user mobility: low, moderate, and high level of mobility. Considering the delay-tolerant nature of real-time applications in wireless IP networks, the effect of delay tolerance on the overall system performance is also investigated. We discuss the suitability of MBAC in wireless IP networks by comparing its pros and cons with traditional parameter-based schemes, and then describe its procedures. Next, we discuss simulation details, and present simulation results with discussions. We compare new and hand-off traffic performance with strictly policy-based and policy and traffic characteristic-based admission control schemes. In the conclusion, we briefly discuss the effectiveness of MBAC and its role in 3G and forthcoming 4G networks.

AB Key developments in Franco-African relations since 1994 are reviewed. Reservations are expressed about the widely held view that these relations have undergone a process of normalization in recent years and that France is disengaging from its traditional pre carre (sphere of influence) in Black Africa. Instead, it is argued that, under pressure from a rapidly evolving international environment and a changing domestic policy context, a partial modernization of French African policy has taken place. This new global environment has imposed constraints on French African policy but has also presented France with new opportunities to pursue its national interests in Africa, in the context of globalization and international liberalism. However, certain features of the special relationship remain, such as the role played in Franco-African relations by the reseaux (personal networks). It is therefore concluded that, while a process of adaptation has indeed taken place, Franco-African relations are at present in a period of transition.

TI Can a territorial policy be based on science alone? The system for
   creating the Natura 2000 network in France
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Decreed in May 1992 by the EEc with a view to conserving biodiversity, the Habitats directive envisages, between now and the year 2004, constructing a European ecological network named Natura 2000. The implementation of the network, based firstly on compiling a list of habitats and species that could be recognized as being of Community importance, generated considerable conflict in France, to the extent that the directive was suspended in July 1996. The analysis of the Habitats directive system has taken a two-fold approach. The procedures first of all correspond to the tools for reaching the goals set out in the Brussels text, in the time allowed and based on scientific criteria. The second dimension refers to an interpretation of the debates and conflicts generated by the application of the directive's conservation measures on the territory. This second dimension in fact would have been difficult to implement were it not for the support of the area administrators, since their involvement was crucial. In this context, we have interpreted the changes in the procedures of the Habitats directive and the role given to negotiations as well as the issues raised by the nature conservation policies that could no longer be restricted to scientific criteria.

TI On a multicommodity flow network reliability model and its application
   to a container-loading transportation problem
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONS RESEARCH SOCIETY OF JAPAN
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is mainly to extend the MMCF (multi-commodity minimum cost flow) problem from deterministic flow networks to stochastic cases. Under the transportation budget constraint, this paper proposes an approach to calculate the probability that the required amount of multi-commodity can be transmitted successfully through a stochastic flow network. Such a probability is called transportation reliability. An algorithm is proposed first to find out all lower boundary points for the requirement in terms of minimal paths. The transportation reliability can then be calculated in terms of such lower boundary points. A numerical example, in which two types of commodities are shipped in container under two container-loading policies, is presented to illustrate the application of such a reliability model.

AB Long-term integrated monitoring is an important approach for investigating, detecting and predicing the effects of environmental changes. Currently, European freshwaters, glaciers, forests and other narural and semi-natural ecosystems and habitats are monitored by a number of networks established by different organisations. However, many monitoring programmes have a narrow focus (e.g. targeting individual ecosystems) and most have different measurement protocols and sampling design. This has resulted in poor integration of ecosystem monitoring at a European level, leading to some overlapping of efforts and a lack of harmonised data to inform policy decisions. The need for a consistent pan-European long-term integrated monitoring of terrestrial systems programme is recognised in the scientific community. However, the design of such a system can be problematic, not least because of the constraints imposed by the need to make maximum use of existing sites and networks. Based on the outcomes of the NoLIMITS project (Networking of Long-term Integrated Monitoring in Terrestrial Systems), this article reviews issues that should be addressed in designing a programme based on existing monitoring sites and networks. Four major design issues are considered: (i) users' requirements, (ii) the need to address multiple objectives, (iii) role of existing sites and (iv) operational aspects.

AB Europe faces major challenges when it comes to formulating its transportation policy. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are considered a key tool to create the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that Europe needs. In freight transportation, ICT is seen as playing a crucial role in providing efficiency in freight transportation operation and in integrating it within the overall ITS that are now being put in place in Europe. The issues and priorities for freight transportation integration with the European ITS are presented, with concentration (as one such priority) on the issue of linking freight transportation management systems with the advanced traffic-management systems of the European ITS. Also covered are the results so far of the thematic network THEMIS, which concentrates on the relation between freight transportation and ITS. A thematic network is a special type of research project, financed by the European Union's Directorate General of Transport and Energy in order to review and synthesize the results of research in a specific field, in this case freight transportation. The efforts made at the European level toward the formulation of a common, ITS-based freight transportation systems architecture are also reviewed. In this respect, there is a report on work done within project THEMIS.

AB Analytical models are proposed for various direct sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) call admission control schemes. Many mathematical call admission models for DS/CDMA cellular networks have been proposed. However, they have shortcomings. First, by ignoring the stochastic traffic load variation or call blocking effect, they failed to sufficiently characterize the second moment of other-cell interference. This leads to inaccurate analysis of a real network. Second, the optimal control parameters were often obtained through an exhaustive search which was very time consuming. Finally, the estimation of system capacity in previous models was obtained by using a simple one-slope path-loss propagation model. However, it is well known that a two-slope path loss propagation model is needed in a line-of-sight (LOS) microcell propagation environment. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for call admission to overcome these drawbacks. In addition, we combine a modified linear programming technique with the built analytical model to find better call admission control schemes for a DS/CDMA cellular network.

AB This paper explores the preferences that companies have as they use alternative (quasi) external sources of innovative competencies such as strategic technology alliances, mergers and acquisitions, or a mix of these. These alternatives are studied in the context of distinct industrial, technological and international settings during the first half of the 1990s. Different strategies followed by companies and the role played by routinized sets of preferences are also taken into consideration. The analysis demonstrates that these options are influenced by both different environmental conditions and firm specific circumstances, such as those related to protecting core businesses.

AB In this paper we describe MIRA, a distributed and scalable architecture for flow-based monitoring and traffic analysis. MIRA relies on data inspection to provide advanced monitoring services such as Acceptable User Policy auditing. It is based on a low cost hardware platform that can be deployed in both LAN and WAN environments. The distributed architecture of the measurement platform is designed to provide real-time global results from a complex network. Processing rate can be seamlessly increased by the addition of new hardware elements. The MIRA architecture has been thoroughly tested in a field trial on RedIRIS, the Spanish National Research Network.

The Common Tools Environment was created to provide a consistent means for accessing design tools and initiating operating system variables from multiple sites in a site-independent manner. The AIX(R) operating system and the Common Tools Environment masked local, site-specific details of the design environment, allowing site-specific design practices, shared storage, and information system policies to be transparently maintained. The design data-management system, the importance of highly reliable wide- and local-area networks, and the establishment of automated network monitoring are discussed.

DE Information needs; Problem structuring; Water management; Stakeholder

AB Specification of information needs is an important step in the design of monitoring networks. Within the framework of Monitoring Strategy 2000+, a programme of the Dutch Directorate General of Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) which seeks to provide innovation in the monitoring sector, a method has been developed to link water management policy to monitoring through specification of information needs. Over the past 2 years, this method has been applied in several projects within the Rijkswaterstaat organisation. Use of this method has led to improvements in the monitoring practice and was judged very positively by the people involved. Nevertheless, the main obstacle to employing the method was the actual translation of policy matters into information products. A special study is carried out, focusing on this aspect within the method, to provide the participants of a project with a mental framework that enables them to clearly specify their information needs. The major requirements for this mental framework are that all participants have a clear view of the process (system), and that they are able to relate their contribution to this process and to the contributions of others (transparency). The first step of the process is to focus the attention of stake-holders on the information they will actually need for decision-making. The next step is to confront the different expressed opinions through the method of the 'devil's advocate', which implies criticising the results of the first step by finding as many as possible arguments against these opinions. This should force the stakeholders to better specify their arguments. The method, its improvements and the results of one pilot project will be discussed in this paper.

   TRAVEL; INVESTMENT; MODELS; DEMAND
AB In this paper and its sequel we investigate the contribution of suppressed and induced traffic to emissions and user benefits derived from new roads and capacity changes under different pricing regimes. Equilibrium transport models are used to appraise selected highway and pricing policies over the period 2000-20. Here we examine the suppression of demand through increasing congestion in two reference states against which capacity changes will be appraised in the second paper. The first state is the consequence of 'doing nothing' over the twenty-year period; the second corresponds to the imposition of marginal cost (congestion) pricing on network links. Taking both a network model of Cardiff and a single representative link (SRL) model, we estimate the effect of suppressed demand on the emission of: carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and carbon dioxide. We show both analytically and numerically that, by reducing effective growth and moderating speeds, the suppression of traffic can have significant implications for vehicle emissions in the peak period, the effect varying in proportion to the elapsed time from the base year. At a travel time elasticity of -0.25, congestion pricing is shown to make an important contribution to containing all emissions, reducing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide peak volumes by a quarter to a third of their unpriced level by the year 2010.

AB This paper considers the hydrogeological simulation of groundwater movement in karstic regions using a hydrological modelling system (SHETRAN) which has been adapted for modelling flow in karstic aquifers. Flow and transport through karstic aquifers remains poorly understood, yet quantitative hydrogeological models are essential for developing and implementing groundwater protection policies. The new model has been developed and used within the STALAGMITE (Sustainable Management of Groundwater in Karstic Environments) project, funded by the European Commission. The SHETRAN model is physically based insofar as most of the parameters have some physical meaning. The SHETRAN model represents all of the key processes in the hydrological cycle, including subsurface flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones, surface flow over the ground surface and in channels, rainfall interception by vegetation canopies, evapotranspiration, snow-pack development and snowmelt. The modifications made to SHETRAN to simulate karstic aquifers are (1) the coupling of a pipe network model to a variably saturated, three-dimensional groundwater component (the VSS-NET component), to simulate flow under pressure in saturated conduits; (2) the coupling of surface water features (e.g. sinking streams or "ponors", and spring discharges) to the conduit system; (3) the addition of a preferential "bypass" flow mechanism to represent vertical infiltration through a high-conductivity epikarst zone. Lastly, a forward particle tracking routine has been developed to trace the path of hypothetical particles with matrix and pipe flow to springs or other discharge points. This component allows the definition of groundwater protection zones around a source for areas of the catchment (watershed) which are vulnerable to pollution from non-point sources (agriculture and forestry).

AB The International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) was established in May 1975. Since then, IVACG has actively led the campaign against vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD). It operates through a network of policy makers, program administrators, and scientists interested in resolving the problem of VADD. Through its international meetings, IVACG provides a forum to exchange new ideas, to discuss research findings and their policy implications, and share experiences with program interventions. It provides technical guidance through state-of-the-art publications on VADD. More than 30 technical references have been developed. IVACG collaborates with international organizations in developing and establishing policy guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of VADD. During its 25 years, IVACG has given careful consideration to the role of vitamin A in infections, morbidity and mortality; assessment methods for use in the field and laboratory; other micronutrients and their interaction with vitamin A; bioavailability of vitamin A in foods; various interventions including supplementation, fortification and dietary diversification; the link between science and action; and sustainable control of VADD. IVACG is recognized as a credible source and galvanizing force in the field. It should continue to identify important research and policy issues and provide policy recommendations upon which others can act. Greater emphasis should be placed on integrated and multisectoral strategies, taking into account a community's overall needs for social, economic, and ecologic development.

AB Recent developments in the new economic geography and the literature on regional innovation systems have emphasised the potentially important role of networking and the characteristics of firms' local operating environment in shaping their innovative activity. Modeling UK, German and Irish plants' investments in R&D, technology transfer and networking, and their effect on the extent and success of plants' innovation activities, casts some doubt on the importance of both of these relationships. In particular, our analysis provides no support for the contention that firms or plants in the UK, Ireland or Germany with more strongly developed external Links (collaborative networks or technology transfer) develop greater innovation intensity. However, although inter-firm links also have no effect on the commercial success of plants' innovation activity, intra-group Links are important in terms of achieving commercial success. We also find evidence that R&D, technology transfer and networking inputs are substitutes rather than complements in the innovation process, and that there are systematic sectoral and regional influences in the efficiency with which such inputs are translated into innovation outputs.

TI The changing support strategies of Chinese families in the midst of
   rapid social and economic transitions
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
LA English
DT Article
AB Families in China have been relying heavily on their own family networks fur support during times of adversity. However, the rapid social and economic changes brought about by the introduction of the "open-door economic Policy" have drastically changed the pattern of support strategies adopted by Chinese families in the PRC. The support resources provided by traditional family networks are becoming increasingly inadequate in supporting Chinese families to cope with changing environmental demands. In order to minimise risks and maximise opportunities for survival amidst rapid social and economic transitions, diversification of family support strategies is therefore necessary. This paper draws from the findings of a qualitative research conducted in Beijing on 17 Chinese couples to illustrate the inadequacies of the "family network support strategy", and the strength of the more "proactive support strategy" in coping with changing environmental demands.

AB The provision of traveler information services in the form of route planning and guidance (RPG) often involves three parties: service providers, users, and the traffic management agency. Each of these parties has distinctive objectives that are often in conflict with each other. This study developed a mixed-equilibrium model to consider the implementation of RPG services. We modeled the market penetration of RPG services in an elastic manner and developed a methodology to study the tradeoff among these conflicting objectives. The goal is to seek solutions that can sustain. This model can also be used to investigate the sensitivity of government policies on these services. Numerical results of a small network are provided to illustrate the behavior of this model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SUBSIDIARY
AB From the late 1980s, government policies and actions have influenced the remarkable rise in Ireland's economic fortunes. Will Irish business be able to maintain this outstanding performance in the face of a world economic slowdown, and problems brought on by success itself? These questions of sustainability are examined, alongside the implications for management of public policy and of foreign-owned and indigenous Irish enterprises.
   The model of the 'flexible developmental state'(FDS) is applied to Ireland.' New forms of industrial organization-like transnational networks with their fluid global movements of money, information, and resources-are especially appropriate in the FDS. The FDS government plays a key role in integrating local and global business in three ways. One is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and then build local networks of production and innovation around the subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies (MNCs). FDI, in the context of a global economy, was the catalyst that animated the developmental process in 1990s Ireland. The second FDS thrust is to cultivate indigenous networks of innovation and encourage them to internationalize. The third element of the FDS is the creation of a stable macroeconomic and financial environment that fostered Irish adaptation to, and participation in, the global econorny.(2) The 'flexible' component of the FDS is that the Irish government, working through state agencies, shaped the organizational cultures and capabilities of both indigenous firms and MNC subsidiaries, but without directly dictating their activities.

   change in air pollution control policy conflict
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Objectives. To expand scholarly attention to a neglected area of environmental policy and politics, I attempt to test several empirical propositions drawn from the small body of existing research on the politics of market-based environmental regulation. Methods. I analyze public comments on a recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulatory action guiding states on the design of various market-based air pollution control programs. I focus on the types of commenting organizations and the nature, extent, and foundations of their support or opposition to market-based regulatory instruments. Results. I Find more support For than opposition to the use of economic incentive programs in air pollution control. The support from business commenters is not surprising, but the level of support expressed by state regulators departs from previous research findings. Environmental groups are the principal dissenters. Overall, the findings suggest both change and continuity in the politics of air Pollution control policymaking, with sonic possibility of a shift in the contours of the advocacy coalitions in the pollution control policy network. Conclusions. Market-based environmental regulation is still an evolving phenomenon in American public policy. Further research on the politics of its development is in order, and the opportunities to pursue such research are substantial.

TI Developing principles for health impact assessment
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE

DE health impact assessment; transport policy; housing policy
AB Background Policies and practice in many sectors affect health. Health impact assessment (HIA) is a way to predict these health impacts, in order to recommend improvements in policies to improve health. There has been debate about appropriate methods for this work. The Scottish Executive funded the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme to conduct two pilot HIAs and from these to develop guidance on HIA.
   Methods Case study 1 compared three possible future scenarios for developing transport in Edinburgh, based on funding levels. It used a literature review, analysis of local data and the knowledge and opinions of key informants. Impacts borne by different population groups were compared using grids. Case study 2 assessed the health impacts of housing investment in a disadvantaged part of Edinburgh, using published literature, focus groups with community groups and interviews with professionals.
   Results Disadvantaged communities bore more detrimental effects from the low transport investment scenario, in the areas of: accidents; pollution; access to amenities, jobs and social contacts; physical activity; and impacts on community networks. The housing investment had greatest impact on residents' mental health, by reducing overcrowding, noise pollution, stigma and fear of crime.
   Conclusion Although there is no single 'blueprint' for HIA that will be appropriate for all circumstances, key principles to inform future HIA were defined. HIA should be systematic; involve decision-makers and affected communities; take into account local factors; use evidence and methods appropriate to the impacts identified and the importance and scope of the policy; and make practical recommendations.

AB A conceptual model of the development of road administrations that is driven by economic, social, and technological forces is described. Different economies based on agriculture and industry or on services and knowledge produce different road transport characteristics. Technological change affects the demand among transport modes, and recent developments in communications and information technology are now having a major effect on road transport systems and the internal management of road administrations. Road networks undergo different phases of development categorized as birth, growth, upgrading, and maturity. There is a correlation between economic and social development and these road network phases, with developing countries mainly involved in network growth and developed countries mainly focused on network upgrading. Some countries are observing a slowing of increases in car ownership and road travel demand as they move into a more mature phase. Road administrations have responded to these external forces as their road networks have developed. Institutional reform has occurred to bring clearer lines of accountability in policy, regulation, funding, procurement, and delivery functions. Further reform is occurring to take account of the greater involvement of both the community and the private sector in the planning, funding, and delivery of road transport improvements. There-is an ongoing need for road administrations to develop different capabilities as road networks develop. The predominant skill base shifts from engineering during road network growth to management using community-based performance indicators during the network upgrading phase. In the mature phase still greater management skills are needed to integrate road transport with other transport modes, partner with the private sector, and incorporate new information and communication technologies into management processes.

SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS

   traffic; wireless fair queueing; wireless IP networks
AB A unified time-division multiple access (TDMA)based centralized wireless access scheme is proposed for performing the statistical multiplexing of bursty data sources in a wireless packet data network. This scheme combines dynamic bandwidth allocation with admission control and packet conditioning (at the mobile stations) to provide fair bandwidth distribution among bursty data flows with different profile rates (or subscription levels) in an error-prone environment. The dynamic bandwidth allocation policy is credit-based and both the burst-level and the packet-level bandwidth allocations are considered. The performance of the scheme is evaluated using computer simulations for different total subscription levels, for different compositions of flows with different profile rates, and for different channel quality with different channel-error correlation patterns. The simulation results show that the throughput variability among flows with the same level of subscription is considerably small except for long range dependent flows with very high traffic burstiness. The relative throughput fairness among flows with different profile rates can also be achieved. The post facto loss and delay values (i.e., observed average packet delay and average packet loss values) for the flows depend on the corresponding delay tolerance limits of the data bursts, TDMA frame-length, and the wireless link utilization level. The energy efficiency of the wireless access scheme is evaluated in terms of the average transmitter usage time and the average receiver usage time in the mobile stations for both the burst-level and the packet-level bandwidth allocation. The proposed scheme can be used in an adaptive quality-of-service (QoS) framework for dynamically adjusting the QoS for flows in order to accommodate wireless channel errors and user mobility.

AB Using the Laffont et al. (Rand Journal of Economics 1998;29(1):1) framework, a model of competition between vertically integrated telecommunications networks in a deregulated environment is developed. Two local operators compete in linear and non linear tariffs (i.e. two-part tariffs) in the subscribers market. In addition, they are integrated downstream in a potentially competitive sector (i.e. long distance sector) where they face competition of other firms which require (one-way) access to local. networks. The purpose of the paper is to introduce a 'downstream' competition in the usual framework of network competition and to focus on how the one-way access charges are set in an oligopolistic market. In a mature phase of the industry, the presence of competition in both local and long distance sectors leads to lower local and long distance tariffs. The strategic role of the two-way and one-way access charges is pointed out, with particular reference to the effect that the reciprocal (two-way) access charge has on competition in the complementary sector. Finally, in case of competition in two-part tariffs, the paper investigates: (i) the asymmetric case in which only one network is integrated; (ii) the entry process when the two local networks have different coverage. The results show how the level of the two-way and one-way access charges affects the 'level playing field' between networks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many soil scientists feel that their expertise is not being used sufficiently when politicians, interdisciplinary research teams, and various other stakeholders address modern environmental and land-use issues. However, taking a proactive rather than a reactive approach and developing and presenting their expertise in a more productive manner would be a more effective response. This requires innovative approaches. To cope better with conditions in our modern network society, soil scientists must learn to listen to and to communicate with their stakeholders, but, more importantly, they must also learn to present their expertise in a flexible manner and, from the beginning, become thoroughly engaged in settings of joint learning and negotiation.

AB Market power is a prominent issue in the current debate about electricity industry restructuring. Market experiments I conducted with industry subjects via the Internet show the impact of seller concentration, demand-side bidding, and transmission constraints on competition in simulated electricity markets. Realistic modeling of the transmission grid revealed opportunities to exercise market power not found in simpler experimental designs. In particular, increasing the number of sellers in a market did not necessarily reduce market power as standard theory suggests. Rather, locational advantages allowed some players to maintain profits near monopoly levels even when seller concentration was at levels generally considered competitive. The implication is that divestiture of existing local monopolies may not be enough to make electricity markets competitive. I confirm the positive impact of demand-side bidding on competition.

AB We consider the modelling and analysis of public transportation networks, such as railway or subway networks, governed by a timetable. Specifically, we study a (max,+)-linear model of a generic transportation network and thereby give a self-contained introduction to the key ideas underlying the (max,+) algebra. We elaborate on the algebraic structure implied by the (max,+)-model to formulate (and solve) the control problem in the deterministic as well as in the stochastic case. The control problem is here whether a train should wait on a connecting train which is delayed. Our objective is then to minimise the propagation of the delay through the network while maintaining as many connections as possible. With respect to the deterministic control problem, we present some recent ideas concerning the use of (max,+)-techniques for analysing the propagation of delays. Moreover, we show how one can use the (max,+)-algebra to drastically reduce the search space for the deterministic control problem. For the stochastic control problem, we consider a parameterised version of the control problem, that is, we describe the control policy by means of a real-valued parameter, say theta. Finding the optimal control is then turned into an optimisation problem with respect to theta. We address the problem by incorporating an estimator of the derivative of the expected performance with respect to theta into a stochastic approximation algorithm.

AB During recent years, it has become clear that ammonia is an important gas in relation to different environmental issues, such as acidification, eutrophication, human health and climate change (through particle formation). Therefore, there is a growing need to develop and apply instrumentation suitable for research into emission, dispersion, conversion and deposition of ammonia and ammonium. Recently, several instruments were developed suitable for measuring concentrations in ambient conditions even at very low levels, such as ammonia sensors suitable for monitoring and research, deposition measuring systems and aerosol samplers for on-line measurement of aerosol composition. These instruments have been tested and applied in a number of field studies. These studies include dry deposition measurements, ammonium nitrate studies in relation to the (in)direct aerosol effect, emission studies and policy evaluation with concentration and deposition monitoring data. The policy evaluation study showed that the measures to reduce ammonia emissions were not as successful as projected beforehand by statistical studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS

AB The need for innovative snow and ice control techniques and processes has continued to grow as national and European road networks have developed substantially over recent decades. The demand for improvement, including the sophistication of the techniques and technology used, continues to be driven by the increasing need for safe and efficient national and international road freight and passenger transport and by the environmental and other policies affecting highways (roads and bridges).
   The European Commission project 'COST Action 344: Improvements to snow and ice control on European roads and bridges' started in April 1999 as a three-year project, with participation from 18 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom.
   The project's aims are to:
   review existing international practices,
   define snow and ice control requirements in different European climatic regions,
   specify 'Best Practice' in different European climatic regions,
   develop guidelines for the integration of specified snow and ice control methods into network level road management and maintenance systems,
   recommend improvements to driver information and traffic management systems, and
   recommend future research projects.
   This COST Action will promote the exploitation of technological advances in the application and distribution of snow and ice control measures, with a view to providing significant environmental and safety benefits and lower operational costs. Millions of ECUs could be saved through lower operational costs and a reduction in adverse effects on the highway infrastructure and the environment. For road users, more effective management of winter operations could lead to a reduction in traffic delays and accidents. For practitioners, implementation of 'Best Practice' should enhance standards and lead to 'best value' being achieved. The implementation of best value could provide the means to measure the performance of the winter maintenance service within various road administrations. For widespread dissemination of knowledge, interim results of the COST Action are being made available to European and national policy- makers, regional planners, engineers, road and vehicle operators, industry and academia. The internet, a CD-ROM, email, handbooks and events such as workshops, conferences and seminars are also being used to target a wider audience of practitioners and researchers.

AB Policies designed to conserve sites of nature conservation importance are an important aspect of city planning in the UK. London has led the way in putting in place a spatial hierarchy of sites of nature conservation importance designed to protect wildlife habitats from development. Some wasteland habitats associated with derelict and vacant land receive protection in this way but development pressure on these so-called 'brownfield sites' is high and is likely to continue. This paper examines how conservation professionals in the private, public and voluntary sectors are responding to the threats of biodiversity loss and opportunities for habitat creation posed by re-development of brownfield sites. The study draws on in-depth interviews conducted with conservation professionals and the practices employed by ecological advisers employed by developers seeking to re-develop wasteland sites. It finds that practitioners are negotiating their role in the re-development process in different ways. Key issues relate to the role of ecological science in codifying wasteland habitats, uncertainties about how best to evaluate the conservation importance of such sites and the strategies and tactics employed by different practitioners as they seek to mobilise a range of knowledges and practices to secure ecologically sensitive proposals. Scientific knowledge about wasteland habitats has not stabilised in ways that can consistently inform conservation policy and practice. As a result biodiversity issues of wasteland sites are often discounted in the re-development process. Investment in studies of the basic ecology of urban wastelands could provide a firmer scientific foundation on which conservation policies could build. At the same time, many conservation professionals involved in urban re-development are struggling to promote a pro-active approach to secure environmentally sensitive development. The knowledge and co-operation networks being mobilised to support this approach are fluid and unstable, and favourable development outcomes as yet are few. Formalising these networks to achieve more effective engagements with developers and the construction industry could consolidate ecological practices designed to conserve and re-create the biodiversity of wasteland habitats.

AB Since the late 1970s, grass-roots community groups. consumer advocates, and national rand international) environmental organizations have made two main contributions to public discussions, and public policies, affecting the production, use, and disposal of toxic materials. With thr advent of e-mail, listservs, and the World Wide Web, such groups formed global 'early warning' networks that have (1) alerted people to many uses of toxic materials and their effects on wildlife and humans, and (2) advocated new prevention-based public policies, including: assessment of available alternatives as a means of supplementing risk assessments: clean production as: a way of avoiding the use of toxic materials, the substitution principle as a way of systematically reducing the use of toxic materials as time passes: the precautionary principle as a policy response to uncertainties in toxicological science, and zero discharge of persistent or bioaccumulative substances. We describe and discuss numerous important digital resources (web sites, discussion lists, and databases) created and maintained by and for citizen groups. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Web caching aims to improve the performance of the Internet in three ways - by improving client latency, alleviating network traffic and reducing server load. A web cache is basically a limited store of information which helps in presenting a faster web-access environment to the clients. The performance of a cache depends on proper management of this information and effective inter-cache communication. The existing web caches have simple and hard-coded policies which are not best suited for all environments. They offer limited flexibility just in the form of changing some simple parameters such as cache size, peer caches, etc. This drawback motivates the need for a framework for building new web caches tailored to specific environments. In this paper, we describe a domain specific language based on an event-action model using which new local web cache policies and inter-cache protocols can be easily specified. This should make it possible to write a new policy or protocol quickly, evaluate its performance and test it thoroughly using the complete program-execute-debug cycle.

AB In this paper, an efficient scheme is proposed based on,the introduced deadline-credit-based (DC) policy. This scheme is appropriate for any prerecorded media, but is particularly relevant for prerecorded semisoft continuous media (CM) applications. Semisoft are applications with very small initial delay tolerance and, thus, for which very small amount of content may be sent in advance. The proposed policy pushes content toward the end user during the session by taking advantage of any bandwidth underutilization periods, exploiting available storage, and building up fairly a deadline credit to be consumed during periods of overutilization. The scheduling policy is studied for the single-hop case (applicable to the server of the content), as well as for the multihop case (applicable to the server and network nodes). The derived results demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to decrease the amount of required bandwidth (or equivalently induced losses) with respect to alternative schemes without requiring large initial delay, which is not acceptable for semisoft CM applications.

SO MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE reliable multicast; content delivery; wireless device; power constraint;
   bandwidth constraint
AB Existing reliable transport protocols for periodic information dissemination ignore application semantics while attempting to be 100% reliable. "Application Level Framing" (ALF) suggests that taking application semantics into account when designing transport protocols can result in performance that is highly optimized for the network. We apply this principle in designing a policy-based TUNAble semi-reliable multicast protocol (TUNA) for periodic information dissemination. Specifically, TUNA is not constrained to guarantee full reliability, but allows the receiving application to selectively request retransmissions of lost portions of the data stream, based on user-level policies. TUNA uses statistical properties of the data stream to adaptively guide receivers in dynamically altering their reliability policies. This is particularly well matched for satellite systems, where end node to satellite bandwidth is limited, especially when shared by large community of end nodes. Our simulation results show that TUNA is made highly scalable by reducing the number of NACKs sent back to the information source, while keeping the staleness of received data within application-specified bounds. Under large session sizes, TUNA yields a factor of 1.5 to 6 improvement over a fully reliable scheme; for high loss rates, it results in a factor of 1.5 to 5 improvement. TUNA is also able to reduce contention for retransmission request bandwidth in a multiple access backchannel environment. We have implemented TUNA and a prototype application called InfoCaster in the MASH toolkit.

   handoff dropping probability
ID COMMUNICATION-SYSTEMS; BLOCKING; PCS
AB Call admission control is one of the key elements to guarantee the handoff call dropping probability in cellular networks. Among numerous proposals in the literature, the distributed call admission control policy (DCAC) seems to be promising, due to its simplicity and adaptability to changing traffic. However, one crucial assumption used in DCAC is that the actually admitted new calls has to obey a Poisson process to enter the network after the call admission control. Given the dynamic and distributed nature of the control process, this can neither be validated nor be easily implemented. In this paper, we will first discuss a generalized DCAC which eliminates the above assumption and can be used in general environments. Then, a mobility-aware DCAC is introduced, which considers the difference of handoff support between low and high mobility calls in making the CAC decision in order to improve channel utilization. The performance of the modified DCAC scheme is investigated through simulation studies.

DE The Natura 2000 Reserve Network; institutional economics; environmental

AB I describe grassroots resistance that evolved in the rural municipality of Karvia in SW-Finland in response to the introduction and development of the EU-wide protected areas system known as Natura 2000 Reserve Network. I have two main aims in this paper. First, I explore the local forest economy, looking at how it works and how it is structured. This I do by focusing on the multilevel well-being of key actors and by exploring the motives lying behind the behaviours and decisions of people working within the forest economy, particularly forest owners. Second, I identify and describe the principles that can help uncover the conflicts and contradictions between forest economy and conservation planning and create a framework for innovative solutions to such contradictions on the local level.

AB In the spring of 2002, the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission into the Demographic Change finished its work and published its final report. The commission has been working for more than 10 years to analyze the challenges posed to the individual and society by the aging German society in a mid- and long-term perspective (up to 2050). The respective policy recommendations refer to the following issues: housing and living environments, intergenerational relations, family relations and other social networks, competence and productivity in old age, income security, demographic change and its effects on economic trends and the labor market, health, health care, long-term care and social services, migration and integration and the implications of the increasing cultural diversity in society and among the elderly.

AB This paper introduces the NODS project been currently conducted at the LSR-IMAG laboratory, Grenoble - France. NODS aims at defining an open, adaptable, evolutionary architecture that can be extended and customized on a per-application basis. A database system is seen as an infrastructure comprised of co-operating adaptable and extensible services from which applications can build their customized NODS database components. Furthermore, services or database systems configuration can be adapted at runtime (e.g., add new services, change services internal policies), according to environmental changes.

AB The use or the Internet and networked computers has changed the computing environment significantly. While providing convenience. the systems are also more vulnerable to security threats. This article discusses actions that may be taken to enhance security. A comprehensive analysis should be conducted to identify resources that need to be protected. The resources should be classified according to the sensitivity level of information. A cost-benefit analysis should be performed to determine the level of security precautions that should be taken. Since it is impossible to have perfect security, consideration should be given to contingency planning and recovery. If security is compromised, the organization should be able to recover quickly and minimize damages.

AB This paper considers the case of Bangkok where, as in many Asian cities, the expansion of urban areas has outpaced the ability of public entities to manage and provide basic services. One potential way to improve the capacity of neighborhoods to assist in provision or improvement in environmental services is to enhance the positive contributions provided by local social networks and social capital. A conceptual framework is presented to explore the role of social networks in environmental management in polluted urban environments. This is followed by a brief description of the methodology and survey instrument used to collect information from a sample of community households in Bangkok and an analysis of the results from this survey regarding environmental practices, community action, and social networks. Some of the results suggest that increasing the number of social interactions that residents of a community experience is associated with increased community participation as, apparently, is increasing knowledge about what happens to waste or wastewater after it leaves the community. Local public education efforts that focus on useful knowledge about environmental impacts may well be an effective way to encourage community participation.

AB Based on in-depth interviews with women on welfare in San Francisco, this paper examines the spatial extent of the job search and the job search strategies utilized. The reliance of these women on contacts and local work opportunities suggests that the relationship between social networks and daily activity patterns may shape their job search, although other factors, including their lack of education, household responsibilities, lack of appropriate transportation, and lack of familiarity with other neighborhoods, play roles as well. Yet for African American women in particular, working near home may occur more out of necessity than choice, because of their inability to earn more money with longer travel times and their lack of extensive friendship networks and activity patterns. This study has important policy implications for welfare-to-work programs, in particular the importance of developing human capital to compete for better jobs in the formal labor market, but also the possibility of improving work opportunities within the limited labor market radii of low-income women with children.

AB Ethnic minority and low-income populations have some of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the highest rates of physical inactivity, an independent risk factor for CVD. Ethnic minority and low-income women are especially at risk. Because programs designed to increase physical activity have the potential to reduce CVD rates in specific populations, research in this area is expanding. As part of the Women's Cardiovascular Health Network funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the goal of this multi-site project is to identify factors, particularly environmental, policy, and cultural factors, that may influence physical activity among ethnic minority and low-income women ages 20-50 years. To achieve this goal, 42 focus groups were conducted in various locations throughout the United States with African American, American Indian, Latina and White women. Groups represented both urban and rural living environments. This article explains the basis for this project and the methodology used. Other articles in this series explain the results from the focus groups in detail. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI District road-network planning - Lessons from a Nepalese pilot project
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The provision of transport infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, is a key area of development policy, as physical access is seen as a way of improving economic generation opportunities in remote areas. This paper reviews the Pilot Labour-Based District Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (PLRP) in Nepal and its contribution to the preparation of a district transport masterplan. In Nepal, as elsewhere, there is a trend towards decentralised development planning as a way of strengthening rural development at a district level. This decentralisation in Nepal has resulted in district development committees, and rural road-network planning is one of their responsibilities. The PLRP has generally been regarded as a successful way in which to strengthen rural road planning, grassroots involvement and the overall development of districts in Nepal.

TI Architectural options for the next-generation networking paradigm: Is
   Optical Internet the answer?
SO PHOTONIC NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS
LA English

DE optical internet; IP; WDM; MPLS; real time provisioning; RWA
AB Recent advances in optical networking technologies are setting the foundation for the next-generation data-centric networking paradigm, an "Optical Internet". This work addresses one of the most challenging issues facing today's service providers and data vendors; how will the SONET/SDH-based legacy infrastructure currently in place make a graceful transition to the next generation networking paradigm?
   A simplified, two-tiered architecture that requires two types of sub-systems will set the stage for a truly optical internet: service delivery platforms that enforce service policies; and transport platforms that intelligently deliver the necessary bandwidth to these service platforms. If IP can be mapped directly onto the WDM layer, some of the unnecessary network layers can be eliminated, opening up new possibilities for the potential of collapsing today's vertically layered network architecture into a horizontal model where all network elements work as peers to dynamically establish optical paths through the network. This paper presents a balanced view of the vision of the next-generation optical internet.
   The work presented here builds on the IETF multi-protocol lambda switching (MP lambdaS) initiative and addresses the implementation issues of the path selection component of the traffic-engineering problem in a hybrid IP-centric DWDM-based optical network. An overview of the methodologies and associated algorithms for dynamic lightpath computation is presented. Specifically, we show how the complex problem of real-time provisioning of optical channels can be simplified by using a simple dynamic constraint-based routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithm that compute solutions to three sub-problems: (a) routing; (b) constrained-based shortest-route selection; (c) wavelength assignment.
   We present two different schemes for dynamic provisioning of the optical channels. The two schemes use the same dynamic lightpath computation approach proposed here, except that the third component, that is the wavelength assignment algorithm and its implementation, is different for each of the two schemes.

AB The "Austrian mercantilism", a stream of economic thought that had been developing from the second half of the 17(th) century, is defined as rather economic policy connected with certain moments of economic theory. The article analyses the difference between the Austrian mercantilism and other economic conceptions and the interdependence of the former with European and Austrian situation at that time. Paper describes practical economic projects of the second half of the 17(th) century, their theoretical reasons and works of the significant representatives of mercantilism: Becher, Schroder and Hornigk. A particular emphasis is laid on the work of J.J. Becher with his terms "Monopolium", "Propolium" and "Polypolium". There are shown practical activities of the mercantilist authors and their influence on economic policy of the Austrian Monarchy as well as the role of the Becher's "Commercial office".

TI Practising 'biodiversity': The articulation of international, national
   and local science/policy in Guinea
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB 'Biodiversity' has become a central organising concept both in international environmental debate, and among government departments, donors and non-governmental organisations in the Republic of Guinea. This article explores how international imperatives around biodiversity are articulating with existing and historically-shaped practices of science and policy in Guinea, and the extent to which villager's perspectives gain (or fail to gain) influence and authority. At least four sets of science/policy practices currently characterise biodiversity conservation, including (1) the listing of plant and animal species; (2) the exploration of ecosystem dynamics through 'cutting edge' computer modelling techniques; (3) the harnessing of traditional plant medicines, linked with discussion of biopiracy; and (4) the promotion of 'semi-wild' plants, such as oil palms. Each set of practices involves different social relations and funding of science, different international networks, and different political discourses; while each also carries wider importance in shaping national and local social categories and identities. A common feature is that the framing and institutional/funding imperatives linked to international biodiversity debates have promoted practices which reproduce western, colonial distinctions between nature and culture in ways which compromise attempts at 'participatory' conservation.

AB This study examines the policy mechanisms and processes that districts can use to provide high-quality in-service professional development for teachers. The findings are based on a national probability sample of district professional development coordinators in districts that received federal funding from the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. We found that certain management/implementation strategies, such as aligning professional development to standards and assessments, continuous improvement efforts, and teacher involvement in planning, are associated with the provision of higher quality professional development for teachers. Characteristics of high-quality professional development are taken from the research literature and include active learning opportunities, duration, collective participation (e.g., participation of teachers from the same department, grade level, or school), and type of activity (e.g., traditional workshop vs. a more reform-oriented approach, such as teacher networks or study groups.) Thus, in the context of an evaluation of the nation's largest investment in teachers' professional development, this study provides empirical support, from a national probability sample of Eisenhower district coordinators, for the link between federal policies and strategies of support, implementation, and the quality of teachers' professional development.

TI Buffer management and rate guarantees for TCP over satellite-ATM
   networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE buffer management; rate guarantees; TCP; ATM
AB Future broadband satellite networks will support a variety of service types. Many such systems are being design with ATM or ATM-like technology. A majority of Internet applications use TCP for data transfer. As a result, these systems must efficiently transport TCP traffic and provide service guarantees to such traffic. Several mechanisms have been presented in recent literature to improve TCP performance. Most of these can be categorized as either TCP enhancements or network-based buffer management techniques. Providing minimum rate guarantees to TCP traffic has also been suggested as a way to improve its performance in the presence of higher priority traffic sharing the link. However, the relative performance of the TCP enhancements versus the buffer management schemes has not been analyzed for long latency networks. In this paper, we address three issues. First, we present a performance analysis of TCP over satellite-ATM links using a best effort service-the ATM unspecified bit rate (UBR) service. This analysis shows that the relative impacts of buffer management, TCP policies and rate guarantees on TCP performance, depend heavily on the latency of the network. Second, we show through simulations that the buffer size required in the network for high TCP performance is proportional to the delay-bandwidth product of the network. Third, we propose a buffer management scheme called differential fair buffer allocation (DFBA) and show how it is used to implement a service that provides minimum rate guarantees to TCP traffic. An example of such a service is the ATM guaranteed frame rate (GFR) service, which is being standardized by the ATM Forum and the ITU. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Biological invasions are causing significant ecological impacts and economical costs world-wide. Human activities are the primary cause of this conservation and environmental problem. We conducted a stepwise regression analysis between several land-use and socio-economic parameters and the density of alien species in European and North African countries. We found that the parameters that best explained the density of alien plants were the Human Development Index and imports. The extent of terrestrial transport networks and the percentage of protected areas were the land-use variables that best accounted for the density of alien plants. If we are going to influence policies dealing with biological invasions, more emphasis should be placed on the analysis of land-use and socio-economic determinants at different spatial scales and their changes throughout time.

AB A dynamic trip assignment-simulation model for urban intermodal transportation networks is presented. The model considers different travel modes, such as private cars, buses, metro-subway, and high-occupancy vehicles. The model captures the interaction between mode choice and traffic assignment under different information provision strategies. It implements a multiobjective assignment procedure in which travelers choose their modes and routes based on a range of evaluation criteria. The model assumes a stochastically diverse set of travelers in terms of their relevant choice criteria and access and response to the supplied information. The model overcomes many of the known limitations of static tools used in current practice. These limitations relate to the types of alternative measures that may be presented and evaluated and to the policy questions that planning agencies are increasingly asked to address.

AB The adaptive management leitmotiv of "learning to manage and managing to learn" sets out an attractive agenda for dealing with the overwhelming complexity of environmental phenomena that humans have problematized. To ensure that this rallying cry translates into effective action, it is important to give consideration to structures and procedures for facilitating the efforts of those willing or able to respond to the adaptive management call. To date, calls to establish the right organization to coordinate multiagency responses have tended to emphasize the noun, or bounded-entity, sense of the word organization. We believe that this is at the expense of its other, verb or process, connotation. In this paper, rather than searching for the perfect organization structure that mandates mutual trust and collective action shaped by all relevant parties' perspectives and possible contributions, we direct attention towards the process of nurturing integrated adaptive responses among individuals who have diverse organizational allegiances. By shifting the balance towards the process connotation of the right organization, we hope that a new mindscape can be discerned for those interested in putting adaptive management principles into practice. We seek to conjure up an image of this mindscape through the phrase "learning to network and networking to learn," and set out to strengthen this by demonstrating how adaptive response networks can arise from the mutually defining relationship between stakeholders and issues. This is demonstrated through a local response to the United Kingdom's National Air Quality Strategy.

AB To date, research into reconfigurable mobile communications has predominantly focussed on the software radio concept, and specifically on the hardware technologies required to move physical layer processing into a programmable environment [1, 2, 3]. Although an interesting and necessary challenge, this only represents a fraction of the overall support and technology required to realise the potential of the concept. Other necessary developments include network/terminal cooperation for seamless inter-standard handoff, QoS management for software download and reconfiguration, a secure software download mechanism, terminal software and mobile radio network architecture supporting terminal reconfiguration, management for software downloads, configuration management, capability negotiation, radio resource management and spectrum allocation policies etc... This paper describes results from the European IST TRUST (Transparently Reconfigurable UbiquitouS Terminal) [4] project concerning user and operator requirements, the proposed overall system environment, security issues, concerted radio resource management, and expected time frame for the development of reconfigurable terminals.

TI An evaluation of Maglev technology and its comparison with high speed
   rail
SO TRANSPORTATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB High speed rail (HSR) systems have a proven record of efficient services in about a dozen countries. Recently, Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology for high speed ground transportation (HSGT) has been proposed for many intercity and regional lines in Germany, Japan, United States, and other countries. Maglev developers claim that their system can achieve higher speeds, have lower energy consumption and life cycle costs, attract more passengers, and produce less noise and vibration than high speed rail. This article presents a systematic comparison of the proposed Maglev system, specifically the German Transrapid, and high speed rail systems.
   The analysis reaches the following conclusions on the three most important system characteristics. First, recent developments of HSR have reduced the advantage of Maglev in higher speeds, so that the differences in travel times on typical interstation spacings would be small. Second, high speed rail has a huge advantage over Maglev due to HSR's compatibility with existing rail networks. Third, high speed rail involves a lower investment cost, while operating costs on Maglev are still uncertain. Energy consumption is estimated to be lower for high speed rail. All other features, like riding comfort, system image, grade climbing ability, noise, etc., are not significant enough to make one mode superior to the other. Thus the benefits of high speed rail strongly outweigh Maglev's small travel time advantage. Based on this conclusion, the soundness and direction of US federal policy of investing in Maglev systems while neglecting high speed rail and Amtrak is questioned.

ID MANAGEMENT; DESIGN
AB The control and management of Web-based service quality require the extension of the Internet infrastructure with monitoring functions to ascertain dynamically the state of networked resources. We describe the design and implementation of the Monitoring Application Programming Interface (MAPI), a Java-based tool for the on-line monitoring of Internet heterogeneous resources, which provides monitoring indicators at different levels of abstraction. At the application level, it instruments the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to notify several different types of events triggered during the execution of Java applications, e.g. object allocation and method calls. At the kernel level, MAPI inspects system-specific information generally hidden by the JVM, e.g. CPU usage and incoming network packets, by integrating with Simple Network Management Protocol agents and platform-dependent monitoring modules. MAPI is the core part of a portable tool for distributed monitoring, control and management in the Internet environment. The tool is implemented in terms of mobile agents that move close to the monitored resources to enforce distributed management policies autonomously, with a significant reduction in both reaction time and traffic overhead.

   bandwidth assignment signaling; real-time variable bit-rate traffic;
   traffic shaping
AB In this paper, a new scheme for the management of real-time traffic over high-latency broadband satellite networks is described. Early studies on this topic have been reported in [8], with reference to an integrated terrestrial-satellite platform. In this paper, further enhancement is introduced into the traffic management scheme with a view to both the reduction of intrinsic impairments caused by the adverse operational environment and the achievement of better performance levels and QoS guarantees. A real-time traffic handling strategy, including distributed connection admission control (CAC) and traffic resource management (TRM) schemes, is harmonized with an in-band signaling technique for burst-based bandwidth request and with an effective policy for the allocation of radio resources. Furthermore, the impact of traffic reshaping at the satellite terminal on the CAC-TRM technique is tested. Added features reduce adverse effects of the long propagation delay across the satellite link and show outstanding effectiveness in improving CAC-TRM performance. and network resource efficiency, while matching service quality requirements. The main reason for the improved performance of the overall management scheme is the adaptability to different traffic profiles conveyed over satellite links.

DE buffer management; congestion control; explicit window adaptation; TCP
ID NETWORKS
AB We study the performance of TCP in an internetwork consisting of both rate-controlled and nonrate-controlled segments. A common example of such an environment occurs when the end systems are part of IP datagram networks interconnected by a rate-controlled segment, such as an ATM network using the available bit rate (ABR) service. In the absence of congestive losses in either segment, TCP keeps increasing its window to its maximum size. Mismatch between the TCP window and the bandwidth-delay product of the network will result in accumulation of large queues and possibly buffer overflows in the devices at the edges of the rate-controlled segment, causing degraded throughput and unfairness. We develop an explicit feedback scheme, called Explicit Window Adaptation, based on modifying the receiver's advertised window in TCP acknowledgments returning to the source. The window size indicated to TCP is a function of the free buffer in the edge device. Results from simulations with a wide range of traffic scenarios show that this explicit window adaptation scheme can control the buffer occupancy efficiently at the edge device, and results in significant improvements in packet loss rate, fairness, and throughput over a packet discard policy such as Random Early Detection (RED).

TI Feedback priority control for MPEG video transmitted through ATM

SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE MPEG; feedback priority control; ATM networks
AB Although ATM networks are suitable for transporting variable bit rate (VBR) traffic, bursty moving picture exports group (MPEG) traffic is tending to make the networks congested and results in cell loss. It is suggested that cells should be assigned different priorities according to the significance of the contained information such that the networks can try to protect the high-priority cells and obtain high video quality. Considering the payload behind the slice header, losing any cell would disable the decoding for the following part of the same slice. As a result, if any cell has to be discarded, the farther the position is, the lesser the following data are affected. In this article, a simple mechanism called 'feedback control priority partition with RC-shaper (FBCPP&RC)' is proposed to prevent losing cells at the former position by adaptively assigning high priority to these cells. The decision policy is simple and quick. It also employs an RC-shaper to smooth the burstiness of the cells so as to reduce cell-loss probability. The mechanism is expected to facilitate transmitting MPEG video as a cheaper available bit rate (ABR) traffic rather than VER traffic. According to the simulation results. it performs well in improving the quality of single-frame as well as continuous pictures. It can also be applied to the new standard MPEG-II.

TI A practical architecture for implementing end-to-end QoS in an IP
   network
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB All critical elements now exist for implementing a QoS-enabled IP network. It can be built on commercially available platforms and then evolve by adopting emerging standards and technologies. This article describes a practical architecture for end-to-end QoS in an IP environment including incorporation of established, as well as developing, IP and QoS technologies. The article combines the IETF QoS mechanisms with the LAN aspects of QoS and QoS for VoIP - areas usually considered separately. Proposed solutions span across different technologies, e.g., preservation of IP-based classification in MPLS headers, identification of flows encrypted within IPSec during WAN handling, traffic shaping in the access to enable grooming diverse applications and VPNs in the WAN, and so on. VoIP receives special emphasis because of its unique features, such as call setup signaling and call admission control, rarely addressed in traditional IP QoS discussions. An attractive scenario for the IP QoS implementation is to provide a multiservice environment between large enterprise premises over a service provider's core network. A successful end-to-end realization of this service presumes well-defined interworking between the SP's and customers' networks. It will take place on several levels including IP signaling, VoIP setup and CAC, policy interworking, and exchange of billing information. The article recommends to establish SP's presence at the enterprise premises and to implement interworking entities such as the proposed QoS customer server and QoS network server.

LA English
DT Article
DE environment; transport planning
AB The paper describes the work of the Strategic Environmental Assessment in the Trans-Pennine Corridor undertaken for the Regions in Partnership Steering Group in 1998-89. The study had two purposes: (a) to contribute to the developing body of knowledge on best practice on strategic environmental assessment designed to assess improvements to the European Commission's Trans-European Transport Networks; and (b) a multi-modal land-use and transport study designed to lead to a preferred environmental and development strategy for the Trans-Pennine corridor. The study was intended to be strategic, both in its identification of options and in its assessment of impacts. It was to look forward over a 25-year planning period, and the focus was to be on long-distance movements and the interactions between these and local movements. The paper explains the study process. The objectives of the environmental and development strategy are set out, and the appraisal framework outlined. The three key appraisal tools-the transport model, the land-use model, and the geographic information system-are then explained. The forecasts of travel demand for the year 2021 are next presented. These forecasts form the basis for the development and appraisal of ten land-use, environmental and transport options. The paper briefly describes the options, and presents results in terms of impacts on travel, land-use and the environment. While the study successfully demonstrated a methodology for strategic environmental assessment, further work on the land-use and transport strategy is required before firm conclusions can be drawn and the broad outline strategy can be converted into specific policies or plans. Nevertheless, the results presented here show a promising approach to developing an environmental and development strategy for the corridor within the policy framework provided by the Government's Integrated Transport Policy.

AB The paper begins by giving the background to the successful Metrolink light rail system in Greater Manchester. It then analyses the reasons for this success which stem from the fact that it has been able to offer passengers a faster and higher-quality journey than both the car and bus. This success as a transport system has led to both social and economic benefits for the community as a whole, including the reduction of road traffic. Next, the development of the plans for the expansion of the network are examined, showing how the factors which have led to the success of the first phase have been built into the plans for future lines. The paper concludes by looking at three specific aspects which are crucial to the delivery of an expanded system: the implications of the Transport and Works Act, procurement and funding, and the development of integrated transport networks under the Government's transport policies.

ID VEHICLE ALLOCATION PROBLEM; MODEL; TRANSPORTATION
AB This paper investigates decentralized control methods for managing equipment inventories in the longhaul portion of less-than-truckload (LTL) networks. Performance is measured with respect to: (1) cost of moving empty equipment, (2) cost of owning equipment, and (3) backorders due to stocking out of empty equipment. Our basic approach has two steps: solve a static linear program to determine where to obtain empty equipment, and apply a pull-based re-order rule to determine when to move empty equipment. The method is applied to a non-stationary dataset representing one year of shipments for one of the United States' largest LTL carriers. With sufficient systemwide inventory, transportation cost was found to be very close (<1% difference) to its lower bound (derived from static data), with infrequent backorders.

ID ECONOMY
AB Southern Louisiana has played host to the oil industry for nearly a century. While much of the contemporary activity is offshore, the communities of southern Louisiana provide labor and support to this vast enterprise. Truck-based transportation is one component of this support industry. In the past, the trucking industry meshed with the social and familial networks of the region, but state-level deregulation has rendered these connections inert. Based on interviews with truck drivers and truck company owners, this paper maps the historic importance of these social networks and gauges the impact of deregulation in social, rather than economic, terms. While the paramount impact of deregulation has been significant losses of power and control by local communities, the aftermath of these policy changes has opened up the trucking industry to new ethnic, geographic. and gender groups.

AB This paper considers a continuous-time non-Markovian parallel queueing system subject to external disturbances. The servers are mutually interfering in that their service rates are nonlinearly interdependent functions of the controls applied by the servers, and external discrete-valued continuous-time random disturbances. At certain time epochs, namely, every A time units, the servers may adjust their service rates by Chancing the values of their controls; however, the system may change its state several times between successive decision epochs. The stability region of the system is established and a service rate control policy pi* is provided, where an arrival rate vector in the interior of the region is sufficient for stability under pi*, and a vector in the closure is necessary for stability under any policy. The stability region depends on A and the variations of the disturbances between decision epochs, and pi* does not require knowledge of the arrival rates. The stability region is not in general monotonic in Delta, but under perfect continuous control (Delta = 0) the stability region is a superset of that under Delta > 0. This queueing model captures essential features of resource allocation and stochastic control problems encountered in a number of telecommunication, transportation, and manufacturing systems.

AB Indonesia is rapidly losing its forests. In some measure this is due to the extensive illegal logging networks operating in heavily forested districts across the archipelago. While the extent of this critical problem is now understood, insufficient attention has been paid to its underlying political and social causes at the district level. Based on fieldwork carried out in Sumatra during 1996-1999, this article examines the emergence and operation of logging networks in one district. This article argues that the roots of illegal logging can be found in the shifting economic and political interests of diverse actors at the district, subdistrict, and village levels. As these actors enter into exchanges and accommodations around logging, they create the de facto institutional arrangements governing timber operations. After examining the impact of political and economic changes on this phenomena, this article concludes that the logging epidemic has complex, multidimensional causes that allow for no easy remedies. Moreover, as many of the dynamics described here will continue to predominate after Indonesia implements new decentralization laws, this ensures that the informal system of exchange and accommodation described here will continue to shape forest outcomes.

DE Grid computing; modelling; simulation; scheduling; performance

AB Clusters, Grids, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have emerged as popular paradigms for next generation parallel and distributed computing. They enable aggregation of distributed resources for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. In Grid and P2P computing environments, the resources are usually geographically distributed in multiple administrative domains, managed and owned by different organizations with different policies, and interconnected by wide-area networks or the Internet. This introduces a number of resource management and application scheduling challenges in the domain of security, resource and policy heterogeneity, fault tolerance, continuously changing resource conditions, and politics. The resource management and scheduling systems for Grid computing need to manage resources and application execution depending on either resource consumers' or owners' requirements, and continuously adapt to changes in resource availability.
   The management of resources and scheduling of applications in such large-scale distributed systems is a complex undertaking. In order to prove the effectiveness of resource brokers and associated scheduling algorithms, their performance needs to be evaluated under different scenarios such as varying number of resources and users with different requirements. In a Grid environment, it is hard and even impossible to perform scheduler performance evaluation in a repeatable and controllable manner as resources and users are distributed across multiple organizations with their own policies. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a Java-based discrete-event Grid simulation toolkit called GridSim. The toolkit supports modeling and simulation of heterogeneous Grid resources (both time- and space-shared), users and application models. It provides primitives for creation of application tasks, mapping of tasks to resources, and their management. To demonstrate suitability of the GridSim toolkit, we have simulated a Nimrod-G like Grid resource broker and evaluated the performance of deadline and budget constrained cost- and time-minimization scheduling algorithms.

AB The construct of social capital has recently captured the interest of researchers in social epidemiology and public health. The authors review current hypotheses on the social capital and health link, and examine the empirical evidence and its implications for health policy. The construct of social capital employed in the public health literature lacks depth compared with its uses in social science. It presents itself as an alternative to materialist structural inequalities (class, gender, and race) and invokes a romanticized view of communities without social conflict that favors an idealist psychology over a psychology connected to material resources and social structure. The evidence on social capital as a determinant of better health is scant or ambiguous. Even if confirmed, such hypotheses call for attention to social determinants beyond the proximal realm of individualized sociopsychological infrastructure. Social capital is used in public health as an alternative to both state-centered economic redistribution and party politics, and represents a potential privatization of both economics and politics. Such uses of social capital mirror recent "third way" policies in Germany, the United Kingdom, and United States. If third way policies lose support in Europe, the prominence of social capital there might be short lived. In the United States, where the working class is less likely to influence social policy, interest in social capital could be longer lived or could drift into academic limbo like other psychosocial constructs once heralded as the next big idea.

TI Urban renewal in Hong Kong: transition from development corporation to
   renewal authority
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE development corporations; Hong Kong; multiple land ownership;
   public-private development partnerships; urban renewal
AB This paper assesses the record of Hong Kong's Land Development Corporation and considers the reasons for its recent transformation into an Urban Renewal Authority. After reviewing the Corporation's first two phases of projects launched in 1988 and 1992, the paper examines how the Hong Kong Government failed to equip it with adequate powers and resources. As a result, although the LDC certainly established itself as an important actor in urban redevelopment, its own flagship projects took much longer to deliver than originally anticipated and did not produce any major restructuring of land use patterns or transport networks. This recent experience of urban renewal in Hong Kong offers more general lessons for renewal policy elsewhere. These concern the nature of public-private relations, the importance of effective linkages between strategic planning and implementation and the dangers of uncritical policy transfer from one locale to another.

TI Macroscopic optimum system for management of pavement rehabilitation
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A macroscopic pavement management system has been designed to yield optimum pavement conditions under constrained budgets. The system can predict future pavement conditions from performance curves generated using the serviceability concept developed by the American Association of State Highways and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The pavement performance curves are generated using an incremental analysis of the AASHTO basic design equation. The system then applies an effective optimum decision policy that aims toward maximizing the annual average network present serviceability index according to the expected outcomes of predefined major rehabilitation actions and subject to budget constraints. In contrast to the microscopic approach that considers "short" pavement sections, the macroscopic approach to pavement management uses "long" pavement sections, i.e., projects. Each project is constructed of the same pavement structural section and possesses a unique performance curve. Pavement projects with similar performance trends are grouped into six classes with each class treated as a single entity. The system is particularly beneficial in establishing longterm pavement rehabilitation policies in terms of planning, scheduling, and budgeting.

TI Decision-making in a complex environment: a sociological
   institutionalist analysis of competition policy decision-making in the
   European Commission
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Competition policy; European Commission; lobbying; networks; public
   monopolies; sociological institutionalism
ID INTEGRATION; UNION
AB Although the last decade has seen a large number of studies of the European Commission from institutionalist perspectives, a gap remains as far as the Directorates-General (DGs) are concerned. Institutionalist theories suggest that DGs may adopt a series of roles in response to the different tasks that they face, and sociological institutionalism emphasizes that this development is a significant source of their autonomy. This, in turn, warrants analyses derived from models that are designed to accommodate a considerable degree of complexity. The present article therefore analyses decision-making in the Directorate-General for Competition from a sociological institutionalist perspective, with a view to evaluating the added value in such analysis compared to more parsimonious approaches in the light of a single case study: the mid-1990s case of competition in the Elsinore ferry route between Denmark and Sweden.

AB This article critically assesses the policy orientation, social impacts, and linkages of telecommunications in the United States within a government deregulated policy environment and an increasingly globalized economy. Deregulation has been driven by both ideological and technological demands, stemming from several political and economic transformations in the world economy, the collapse of state socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and greater oligopolistic competition among transnational corporations. An expanded infrastructure of new digital information and communications technology (ICT) is the foundation of a worldwide political economic regime of accumulation. ICT increases command and control capabilities of large corporations, together with the mobility and liquidity of capital, making it essential to the restructuring of the world economy, the new international division of labor, and the creation of global "information city" networks. At the same time, government deregulation and rapid technological change are associated with a number of spatial, economic, and social dualisms.

AB Combinatorial process synthesis is a novel paradigm for flow sheet synthesis. Its two-staged synthesis algorithm generates all feasible operational alternatives followed by rigorous optimization of structurally superior flowsheets. In the conventional practice, process synthesis aims at minimizing total annualized cost. However; designs with maximum economic performance may cause unbalanced environmental impact. It should not be surprising that subsequent cleanup and waste treatment efforts often compound actual process overhead unaccounted for in the traditional design philosophy. Therefore, environmental considerations should be accommodated alongside economic performance. In this first paper of a triple series, we will introduce the concept of combinatorial process synthesis for developing plant-wide recovery and treatment policies for batch manufacturing sites. The flow sheet generation step combined with multiobjective optimization will render operating policies with optimal trade-off among the conflicting objectives cost and environmental impact. The discussion includes case studies illustrating the systematic and fully automatic waste management procedure.

AB Laptop computers provide unsurpassed flexibility and convenience for students in the modern academic environment. Many libraries, including the University of Nevada-Las Vegas's (UNLV) Lied Library, allow students to bring in their own laptops or check out library-owned laptops and connect to the institution's high-speed network. While offering unsurpassed convenience, laptop use must be tempered with appropriate authentication, security, and additional procedural policies to ensure that such privileges are not abused. In addition, libraries must be prepared to accommodate financial and staff-time costs associated with such programs.

AB The toll road concession experience in Argentina during 1990 to 2001 is reviewed. Some guidelines are suggested for the future in terms of thorough bidding qualification procedures, competitive bidding with simple and clear documents, prevention as regards construction firms controlling the concessionaire, agreements designed to reduce renegotiations to a minimum, renegotiations open to international auditing, optimization of risk allocation between the users and the concessionaire, prohibition of contract extension, performance rather than profitability controls, users' control with strong government support, toll collection and investment policy integration over the road network, congestion pricing, and intelligent transportation systems traffic management.

DT Article
DE CDMA; DCA; event driven simulation; interference management; radio
   parameters; radio resource allocation; TD-CDMA; UMTS
AB This paper investigates the impact of major critical parameters and the effect of some radio resource allocation policies on the TD-CDMA system performance. Critical parameters are related either to the users behavior (e.g., users mobility, activity factors) or to processing techniques and algorithms implemented to control network performance and individual radio link quality (e.g., joint detection imperfection, handover margin, timeout for maintaining alive bad radio links). Network topology (e.g., distance between neighboring base stations) also undoubtedly influences capacity results. Analysis is carried out through accurate modeling of users behavior, interference scenarios, and power budget limitations at both terminals and infrastructure, allowing for proper implementation of radio resource allocation algorithms. Among these algorithms, power management (both at the initial channel assignment and during communication), dynamic channel allocation (DCA), and ongoing calls management are explored. An event-driven simulation approach was considered to model realistic system behavior and address system stability under various events generating traffic/interference fluctuations (e.g., call arrivals and departures, handovers, steps of power control loops). Such an approach is expected to offer a good estimate of the real conditions provided the propagation models are close to real life. As a consequence, measures to be taken to avoid/control overloading in a TD-CDMA (CDMA in general) environment can be naturally derived and tested with this methodology.

ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT
AB A two-stage model of land use change is described, which is driven by the types of decisions that land managers make when changing their broad styles of use. The first stage uses decision modelling techniques to assess if a manager is currently satisfied with the present situation, when compared to various potential alternatives. If this evaluation indicates satisfaction, it is assumed that the present land use will continue. However, if it indicates dissatisfaction, Belief Network techniques are used to estimate, in more detail, both how dissatisfied the manager is and whether the costs of changing, from the present use to a potentially better one, will be out-weighed by the anticipated benefits. The proposed models can use a variety of cost and benefit criteria (e.g. financial, social and ecological). The approach is illustrated with a case-study of the factors that might influence changes from farming to forestry in marginal upland areas of the UK.

AB This paper examines the role of institutions in explaining the differences in performance with respect to entrepreneurship and growth in two industry clusters in two countries: the biomedical/biotechnology and polymer-based industry clusters in Sweden and Ohio. Both clusters are about twice as large in Ohio as in Sweden, even though the industrial history and the composition of industrial output in general are quite similar in the two regions, and even though the Ohio economy is only about 25% larger than that of Sweden.
   Four types of institutional factors are examined: The science base and mechanisms of technology transfer; the density of networks and the role of business support services and companies in related industries; the entrepreneurial climate, especially the availability of finance; and the policy environment and other infrastructure.
   Major findings are that the science base plays a different role in the two clusters and that the regions differ in the absorption of new technology, partly due to the differences in the size and structure of firms, that bridging institutions have contributed significantly to connectivity of networks in Ohio, and that the greater availability of venture capital and entrepreneurial management skills makes the Ohio environment for entrepreneurship more supportive than that in Sweden.

AB Road traffic is a major source of air pollution, and substantial effort is currently being devoted to the development of both technological and transport policy measures to reduce the impacts. It is well established that the emission of certain pollutants is closely related to both traffic speed and fluctuations in traffic speed. However, conventional transport emission models are largely based on average traffic conditions, and thus they cannot properly represent the effects of policy measures, such as automatic speed control or traffic calming, that directly affect the speed dynamics of the traffic stream. Given the prevalence of such policies, there has been considerable effort to develop improved emissions modeling capabilities. A new approach to the microscopic modeling of air pollution from road traffic is described. This approach can represent detailed speed fluctuations in the flow of traffic, and it is applied to a local network in Maidstone, Kent, in the United Kingdom. A stochastic microscopic traffic flow simulation model (VISSIM), an existing speed-based emission database (MODEM), and a Gaussian dispersion model are combined. Simulated results are compared with a macroscopic model of air pollutant concentrations (DMRB method) and roadside pollutant measurements. Results are encouraging and show a good comparison with the DMRB method and, with some exceptions, good comparisons with trends in measured pollutant concentrations. Statistical differences in the methods, however, suggest that either measurement error or other inaccuracies are present.

AB This paper examines the design and development of a discrete-event (visual) simulation model of a physician clinic environment within a physician network. Biological & Popular Culture, Inc, (Biopop) sought to partner with healthcare professionals to provide high-quality, cost-effective medical care within a physician network setting. Towards this end, a discrete-event (visual) simulation model that captures both the operations of a family practice healthcare clinic and a centralized information center is presented. The research presented in this article focuses on the family practice healthcare clinic. This simulation model is built in an object-oriented, visual manner utilizing the visual simulation environment (VSE). Application of the object-oriented paradigm (OOP) allows simulation objects in the model to be easily reused. The simulation model provides a tool for risk-free evaluation of operating policies in the clinical environment. Results of a fractional factorial design to determine those input factors which significantly affect overall clinic effectiveness are reported.

AB Climate change effects caused by an increasing concentration Of CO(2) and ozone represent an issue of major concern both for scientists and policy-makers. In a concerted program funded by the Commission of the European Union, a European network of experiments (in open-top chambers (OTC), and free air carbon dioxide enrichment systems (FACE)) and modelling was carried out to investigate the effects of increasing atmospheric CO(2) and ozone concentrations, under different climatic conditions, on potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Bintje). This contribution describes the experimental network and the standard protocol set-up, for the assessments that served to improve and to validate process oriented potato growth simulation models leading to scenarios of future productivity of potato in Europe.

   multi-channel; slotted ALOHA; wireless communications
AB To satisfy huge service demand and multi-traffic requirements with limited bandwidth, this paper proposes two different procedures of multi-channel multiple access schemes with the slotted ALOHA operation for both data and voice traffic and presents an exact analysis to numerically evaluate the performance of the systems. In scheme I, there is no limitation on access between data transmissions and voice transmissions, i.e., all channels call be accessed by all transmissions. In scheme II, a channel reservation policy is applied, where a number of channels are used exclusively for voice packets while the remaining channels are used for both data packets and voice packets. We call the system using scheme I "Non-reservation system" and call the system using scheme II "Reservation system." Performance characteristics we obtained include loss probability for voice traffic, average packet delay for data traffic and channel utilization for both traffic. The performance of the schemes and the effects of the design parameters are numerically evaluated and compared to a wide-bandwidth conventional single-channel slotted ALOHA system with single data traffic. The analysis presented in this paper will be not only useful for the performance evaluation and the optimum design of multi-channel multi-traffic systems in wireless environments, but also applicable to evaluate other performance measures in priority networks, cellular mobile radio networks or multi-hop wireless networks.

DT Article
DE bandwidth allocation; quality of service; statistical multiplexing;
   traffic flow control
ID ADMISSION CONTROL; ATM MULTIPLEXER
AB This paper presents an integrated approach to QoS-guided network bandwidth allocation where each traffic flow requires a sufficient bandwidth allocation to support its mean traffic rate and to meet a delay requirement. Under the assumption that the peak rate of each traffic flow is decreasing with the time interval within which the rate is measured, we derive an analytical relationship between the delay bound and the bandwidth requirement for each individual flow. Then, based on a Gaussian aggregate traffic model, we show that two key controllable parameters, the coefficient of variation and the provision for variation for the aggregate traffic flow, determine all three fundamental QoS attributes (throughput, delay, and loss). We illustrate by examples that these results can be used to design admission policies. We demonstrate also quantitatively a remarkable QoS advantage of larger channel bandwidth in a statistical multiplexing environment. The analytical contributions are expected to be generally useful in QoS-guided bandwidth management in broadband networks.

TI Intelligent transport systems solutions in transitional countries: the

DT Article
AB Transport policy in Korea is driven by the need to cope with ever-worsening traffic conditions. The development of an intelligent transport systems (ITS) Master Plan for Korea is of particular interest and demonstrates the heavy reliance placed on ITS measures to facilitate both the management of congested (but expanding) highway networks and to encourage a shift to greater use of public transport. The paper highlights the major achievements of ITS in Korea by assessing the evidence provided by the widespread implementation of ITS technologies (such as the creation of 'showcase' demonstrations). Some observations from the implementation of ITS in (so-called) transitional economies are presented.

AB We describe a large-scale linear programming model for optimizing strategic (intercontinental) airlift capability. The model routes cargo and passengers through a specified transportation network with a given fleet of aircraft subject to many physical and policy Constraints. The time-dynamic model captures a significant number of the important aspects of an airlift system in a large-scale military deployment, including aerial refueling, tactical (intracontinental) aircraft shuttles, and constraints based on crew availability. The model is designed to provide insight into issues associated with designing and operating an airlift system. We describe analyses for the U.S. Air Force system concerning fleet modernization and concerning the allocation of resources that affect the processing capacity of airfields.

AB Using complementary theories derived from, the foreign-entry mode and alliance literatures and two databases on Japanese/US alliances and investments, this study examines the prevalence - a combination of formation and termination - of the full range of investment and cross-border linkage alternatives available to firms. We find that some combinations among the administrative forms, the knowledge flow intent between the partners, and industry-related technology and risk factors were more prevalent than others. Specifically, there were three prevalent combinations consistent with the notions of production efficiency, transaction cost efficiency and learning/adaptation: (1) wholly owned subsidiaries in low R&D-intense industries with the intent of unidirectional knowledge flow; (2) joint ventures in medium R&D-intense industries with reciprocal knowledge flows; and (3) technical agreements with reciprocal knowledge flows in high-tech industries.

AB Governments and transportation networks are both hierarchically organized. Some state governments finance most of their highways, whereas in other states similar roads are financed locally. Larger governments attain scale economies. However, they also tend to be more bureaucratic and have higher operating costs, all else being equal, because of problems such as span of control. A study was done to relate highway expenditures with the share of expenditure by state governments to determine how governments should allocate expenditure on all roads in a state. Highways are divided into two hierarchical classes (higher and lower), governments into two layers (state and local), and costs into capital and operations and maintenance. Regression models to predict different highway expenditures on each highway class as a function of utilization, capacity, and funding shares are estimated. It is found that there is a share of expenditures by each level of government for each highway class that-results in a minimum expenditure for each funding category (capital and operations). That minimum is not very far from typical state and local mixes found in many states. The results can be applied in formulation of efficient network financing arrangements. Policies can be formulated that would help adjust the financial responsibilities of transportation networks between government layers.

AB This article challenges certain tenets of the theories of reflexive law and ecological modernization. Although farsighted prevention-oriented and structural changes are needed, some proponents of these theories argue that the very industries and firms that create environmental problems can through continuous institutional learning, the application of life-cycle analysis, dialogue and networks with stakeholders, and implementation of "environmental management systems" be transformed into sustainable industries and firms. Although useful, these reforms are insufficient. It is not marginal or incremental changes that are needed for sustainability but rather major product, process, and system transformations-often beyond the capacity of the dominant industries and firms. This article also questions the alleged failure of regulation to stimulate needed technological changes and identifies the conditions under which innovation for sustainability can occur Finally, it discusses differences in needed policies for industrialized and developing countries.

AB Accident risk has been applied extensively in transportation safety analysis. Risk is often used to describe the level of safety in transportation systems by incorporating a measure of exposure, such as traffic How or kilometers driven. The most commonly applied definition of accident risk states that risk is a linear function of accidents and traffic flow. This definition, however, creates problems for transportation systems that are characterized by a nonlinear relationship between these variables. The primary objective of the original research was to illustrate the application of accident prediction models (APMs) to estimate accident risk on transportation networks. (APMs are useful tools for establishing the proper relationship between accidents and traffic flow.) The secondary objective was to describe important issues and limitations surrounding the application of APMs for this purpose. To accomplish these objectives, APMs were applied to a computerized transportation network with the help of EMME/2. The accident risk was computed with the traffic flow output of the computer program. The results were dramatic and unexpected: in essence, the individual risk of being involved in a collision decreases as traffic flow increases. The current and most common model form of APMs explains this outcome. The application of these results may have significant effects on transportation policy and intelligent transportation system strategies.

AB This is the second part of a contribution to the debate on the possibilities of leveraging economic globalisation - through incorporation in international production networks and global commodity chains (GCCs) - as a strategy for developing countries to industrialise and advance their position in the world economy. In the first part, we analysed the experience of the East Asian apparel industry and addressed the issues of sustaining positions, upgrading to more rewarding roles, and advancing to less dependent positions within production networks and GCCs. We developed an analytical framework at both the firm and industry levels, and subsequently identified alternative firm- and industry-level strategies and trajectories. The present paper deals with these issues in the context of the Singapore apparel industry. Based on extensive empirical research, we demonstrate that although the East Asian experience of upgrading and repositioning within the GCC is to some extent emulated in the case of the Singapore apparel industry, the outcomes have been less favourable in terms of the depth, extent and strength of these trajectories. The differing outcomes can be explained in terms of different (systemic) conditions in the Singapore business environment, including the agency of local players, the geography of sourcing networks, and the role of the state and prevailing business attitudes. Our conclusions merit continued attention in both research and policy circles on the development of capabilities at the firm level, and the role of local business and institutional environments in local industry development processes under globalisation.

TI Setting targets in strategies for river restoration
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY

DT Article

   setting targets
AB Since about 90% of the natural floodplain area of rivers in Europe has been reclaimed and now lacks river dynamics, nature rehabilitation along rivers is of crucial importance for the restoration of their natural function. Flood protection, self-purification of surface water, groundwater recharge, species protection and migration are all involved in this process. It is now generally recognised that rivers form natural arteries in Europe but are also of economic importance and are recognisable cultural landscape. Many examples are already available of successful small river restoration projects. Several species thought to be extinct have now reappeared and characteristic species have also expanded in recent years. This paper concentrates on the concept of setting targets for river restoration as exemplified by the Meuse River. A modelling exercise shows the restraints of current habitat configuration and the potential for habitat restoration along the river. A policy analysis, using a strategic approach, illustrates the influence of the decision making process on the targets for natural river development. River dynamics play a key factor in determining the potential for persistent populations of target animal species along the river, with the help of an expert system (LARCH, Landscape ecological Analysis and Rules for the Configuration of Habitat). The potentials for the increase of dispersion and biodiversity and the maximisation of ecological benefits at different scales, are also considered.

AB In July 1999, after the return of the Kosovar refugees to their country, an outbreak of acute hepatitis A (HAV) and E (HEV) occurred, Epidemic hepatitis and diarrhoea are closely monitored communicable diseases which had been singled out as priorities by the health authorities of the former Republic of Yougoslavia, Several field surveys were undertaken, description of reported cases, serological study of clinical patients, study of anti-HAV seroprevalence in a school and a case control study to assess risk factors.
   The analysis of the reports indicates an epidemic peak at the end of September 2 or 3 weeks after the start of the new school year, with an increase of cases relative to the age of the children in school. In a serologic study of 104 samples, we found an anti-HAV IgM positivity in 88% of the cases. Children were more likely to be positive when compared to teenagers and adults, likewise, consumers of well-water as versus those drinking network water (p = 0, 03). The study of seroprevalence showed that transmission had taken place within the school. The case control study, in spite of its imperfections, Indicated that consumption of water melon, the only fruit cultivated locally, is a factor which facilitates the HAV transmission. Circulation of the hepatitis E virus was confirmed for 4 sick persons (including 2 co-infected HAV-HEV) and in 4 persons without clinical symptoms,
   These results show the permanent risk of faeco-oral infections in this area and the need to develop a relevant prevention policy.

AB Environmental justice is the principle that environmental costs and amenities ought to be equitably distributed within society. Due to the ethical. political, and public-health implications, and because many choices confront those researching environmental justice, standardized measures are needed to inform public dialogue and policy. We develop and test semen indices on three Colorado cities to measure the relationship between the distribution of environmental hazards and minority and poverty-stricken populations and recommend the Comparative Environmental Risk Index as a preliminary, standardized measure for comparing urban area. This index is particularly relevant to disadvantaged communities, regional planning organization, environmental-justice networks and scholars, and state and federal agencies.

TI Government and industry partnership to develop rail infrastructure in
   the United States
SO TRANSPORTATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB By 1980, excessive regulation of railroads and competition from other modes of transportation, such as trucks and barges, had nearly killed the rail industry. The federal government tightly regulated the rates railroads could charge shippers and the railroads' ability to shed unprofitable lines.
   The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 ("Staggers Act") eliminated a regulatory scheme in which a government agency set rail rates that uniformly applied to shippers in favor of rates set through negotiations between a railroad and a shipper. The legislation was enacted to unleash the industry from this regulatory regime.
   Since 1980, the financial health of the rail industry has improved, but most railroads remain revenue inadequate-they do not earn enough revenue to maintain their current infrastructure. Even though rail traffic has grown, the rates railroads charge shippers have generally declined over the last two decades. Railroads, therefore, cannot afford to expand their infrastructure to keep pace with traffic growth because building and maintaining a rail network is very expensive. In the future, railroads will have to raise their rates, which may drive less profitable traffic to the nation's highways and waterways, or invest in infrastructure so they can handle more traffic.
   Government policy can help the railroads while simultaneously avoiding additional congestion on our highways and waterways, and reducing pollution, fuel consumption, and damage to the highways. The United States' railroad policy could give railroads more resources to expand their infrastructure and assure that railroads have the proper economic incentives to make the investment in infrastructure necessary to meet the demand for their services. That policy must also encourage creative financing and public-private partnerships to the same end. Finally, policies to promote investment in rail infrastructure must not result in a quid pro quo of increased regulation of the industry. Such regulation would likely negate the benefits of encouraging infrastructure investment by driving away private investment, and the industry would need more public money to survive.

TI EJVM: an economic Java run-time environment for embedded devices

DT Article
DE Java virtual machine; embedded system; memory footprint
AB As network-enabled embedded devices and Java grow in their popularity, embedded system researchers start seeking ways to make these devices Java-enabled. However, it is a challenge to apply Java technology to these devices due to their shortage of resources.
   In this paper, we propose EJVM (Economic Java Virtual Machine), an economic way to run Java programs on network-enabled and resource-limited embedded devices. Espousing the architecture proposed by distributed JVM, we store all Java codes on the server to reduce the storage needs of the client devices. In addition, we use two novel techniques to reduce the client-side memory footprints: server-side class representation conversion and on-demand bytecode loading. Finally, we maintain client-side caches and provide performance evaluation on different caching policies. We implement EJVM by modifying a freely available JVM implementation, Kaffe. From the experiment results, we show that EJVM can reduce Java heap requirements by about 20-50 % and achieve 90 % of the original performance. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Network traffic characteristics impacts directly network performance. and resource allocation policies, In this work. we introduce a multi-agent system, that manages the performance of web servers with minimal cost of mirroring. In our proposed system each web server is viewed as a software agent that perceives its environment by monitoring its traffic. The goal of the agent is to manage the performance. using cooperative mirror servers, while minimizing the cost of mirroring. Communication between the agents enables each web server to decide about its future actions, which is whether to share its load with the cooperative mirror servers. and how much load to assign to them. The architecture of a oft are agent that is intended to manage the performance of a web server, is elaborated and its different modules are described. Also a set of cooperative agents is defined, that form a multi-agent system and is intended to assure maintaining the performance with minimal cost of mirroring. The experimental results presented in this article illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB Current ATM switches offer only a limited potential for traffic control. Furthermore, this functionality is provided in a monolithic "black box" fashion, dependent on the manufacturers' proprietary architectures. This arrangement does not allow network operators and/or value-added service providers to adjust or upgrade the traffic control algorithms either for more efficient operation or for deploying customized traffic control policies and/or protocols.
   In addressing this problem, the paper proposes an open architecture that enables portable installation and transparent high-level operation of a large set of traffic control algorithms, The core of the proposed architecture consists of: a) an abstract information model that provides a virtual environment for portably deploying traffic control algorithms, by separating the functioning of these algorithms from the details of the switch hardware and low-level management/control software; b) a set of generic interfaces complying with the programmable network interfaces of the P1520 reference model; and c) a virtual signaling protocol.
   Besides presenting the architecture, the paper discusses at length a prototype implementation on an ATM network island. The implementation is based on the proposed architectural framework and makes use of intelligent software agents. This prototype is being used as a testbed for the comparative evaluation of traffic control algorithms.

AB Global wireless networks enable mobile users to communicate regardless of their locations. One of the most important issues is location management in a highly dynamic environment because mobile users may roam between different wireless systems, network operators, and geographical regions. In this paper, a location-tracking mechanism is introduced that consists of intersystem location updates and intersystem paging. Intersystem update is implemented by using the concept of boundary location area, which is determined by a dynamic location update policy in which the velocity and the quality of service are taken into account on a per-user basis. Also, intersystem paging is based on the concept of boundary location register, which is used to maintain the records of mobile users crossing the boundary,of systems. This mechanism not only reduces location-tracking costs, but also significantly decreases call-loss rates and average-paging delays. The performance evaluation of the proposed schemes is provided to demonstrate their effectiveness in multitier personal communication systems.

AB A multimedia content is usually read-only and composed of multimedia objects with their spatial and temporal specifications. These specifications given by its author can enforce the display of objects to be well organized for its context. When multimedia contents are serviced in network environment by an on-demand basis, the temporal relationship among the objects can be used to improve the performance of the service. This paper models the temporal relationship as a scenario that represents the presentation order of the objects in a scenario and proposes several scheduling methods that make it possible to rearrange the transmission order of objects in a scenario. As a result, system resources such as computing power and network bandwidth can be highly utilized. Since the temporal relationship of a scenario is static, it is possible to reduce the scheduling overhead of a server by pre-scheduling currently servicing scenarios. In addition, several simulation results are presented in order to compare and analyze the characteristics of the proposed methods.

AB An optimal control methodology and computational model are developed to evaluate multi-reservoir release schedules that minimize sediment scour and deposition in rivers and reservoirs. The sedimentation problem is formulated within a discrete-time optimal control framework in which reservoir releases represent control variables and reservoir bed elevations, storage levels, and river bed elevations represent state variables. Constraints imposed on reservoir storage levels and releases are accommodated using a penalty function method. The optimal control model consists of two interfaced components: a one-dimensional finite-difference simulation module used to evaluate flow hydraulics and sediment transport dynamics, and a successive approximation linear quadratic regulator (SALQR) optimization algorithm used to update reservoir release policies and solve the augmented control problem. Hypothetical two-reservoir and five-reservoir networks are used to demonstrate the methodology and its capabilities, which is a vital phase towards the development of a more robust optimal control model and application to an existing multiple-reservoir river network.

AB Web caching is an important technique for reducing Internet access latency, network traffic, and server load. This paper investigates cache management strategies for the en-route web caching environment, where caches are associated with routing nodes in the network. We propose a novel caching scheme that integrates both object placement and replacement policies and which makes caching decisions on all candidate sites in a coordinated fashion. In our scheme, cache status information along the routing path of a request is used in dynamically determining where to cache the requested object and what to replace if there is not enough space, The object placement problem is formulated as an optimization problem and the optimal locations to cache the object are obtained using a low-cost dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive simulation experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of a wide range of performance metrics. The results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing algorithms which consider either object placement or replacement at individual caches only.

AB Dynamic traffic management (DTM) is the management of traffic streams and of the demand for traffic. Real-time data are essential for correct information to drivers and for control of traffic. Not every variable can be measured directly, so models are necessary to calculate missing information or to predict the future state of the network. This paper follows a top down approach. It starts with the policy context. The different DTM-tools considered are grouped according to their effect either on travel demand, modal split or a specific travel mode. Some recent developments are watched with respect to transport research laboratories. We argue that an emphasis should be laid upon a neat development architecture. For this reason we will pay attention to the traffic model FLEXSYT. The strong point of this model is the use of a traffic control language which allows for the investigation of any type of control for any type of network. Finally we discuss predictability. It is important to identify what can be predicted reasonably and what not. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An organizational approach to coping with the paradox between individual

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT

DE organizational approach; individual careers and collective research;
   paradox; Japan
AB Issues on collective research remain a subject of considerable interest to analysts and policy makers. This paper is a modest attempt at providing some new observations in Japan on one of the issues, namely, the paradox between collective research and individual career. The evidence, based on collective research in Japanese firms and universities, shows that such a paradox does not exist in Japan since the unique lifelong employment custom and various adopted fluid organizations (while keeping individual researchers' original positions stable at the same time) prevented such a paradox from arising. In other words, the paradox is coped with by efforts of transferring 'burdens' from individual researchers to fluid organizations. We called the measures and efforts an organizational approach, Case studies are also provided.
   We also try to point out a re-build-up of the organizational approach due to the latest changes in the collective research environment, and call for revised concerns and efforts from Japanese policy makers and firms' management. Our findings can also shed some light on studying organizational approach and the university-industry network in Japan.

AB In 1998, the North Carolina Legislature mandated a 30% reduction in the nitrogen loading in the Neuse River in an attempt to reduce undesirable environmental conditions in the lower river and estuary. Although sophisticated scientific models of the Neuse estuary exist, there is currently no study directly relating the nitrogen-reduction policy to the concerns of the estuarine system's stakeholders. Much of the difficulty lies in the fact that existing scientific models have biophysical outcome variables, such as dissolved oxygen, that are typically not directly meaningful to the public. In addition, stakeholders have concerns related to economics, modeling, implementation, and fairness that go beyond ecological outcomes. We describe a decision-analytic approach to modeling the Neuse River nutrient-management problem, focusing on linking scientific assessments to stakeholder objectives. The first step in the approach is elicitation and analysis of stakeholder concerns. The second step is construction of a probabilistic model that relates proposed management actions to attributes of interest to stakeholders. We discuss how the model can then be used by local decision makers as a tool for adaptive management of the Neuse River system. This discussion relates adaptive management to the notion of expected value of information and indicates a need for a comprehensive monitoring program to accompany implementation of the model. We conclude by acknowledging that a scientific model cannot appropriately address all the stakeholder concerns elicited, and we discuss how the remaining concerns may otherwise be considered in the policy process.

AB Setting conservation priorities with a geographic vision is essential in developing countries due to limited resources for conservation and the urgency of establishing new reserves. Priorities should reflect the risk ecosystems are facing and how represented they are in current national reserve networks (NRN). Conservation planning, research, and reserve design should focus on priority ecosystems. This study identified the priority ecosystems for the conservation of continental Ecuador's biodiversity using a multi-criteria model developed in collaboration with Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment. This model ranked ecosystems based on four conditions: representativeness in the current reserve network, human pressure, habitat loss, and species-level value based on bird species data. Results show that although Ecuador's reserve network covers approximately 14% of the country, several ecosystems are poorly represented using a conservative 10% level benchmark, while others are not included at all. In general, highly diverse, humid environments are well represented while low-diversity, dry environments, are poorly represented. These low-diversity, low-representation ecosystems are also the most threatened. Conservation programs and new reserves design in continental Ecuador should concentrate on these ecosystems until the desired representativeness is attained. These results were formally presented to Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment in 2000. This study shows that an ecosystem-risk-representativeness approach can be implemented efficiently at scales that take advantage of limited resources yet are effective for policy and planning, Current technologies can be used effectively to map major ecosystems, and to assess various forms of risk and representativeness in reasonable time for a country or a large region.

AB We present a modeling framework for hybrid systems intended to capture the interaction of event-driven and time-driven dynamics, This is motivated by the structure of many manufacturing environments where discrete entities (termed jobs) are processed through a network of workcenters so as to change their physical characteristics. Associated with each job is a temporal state subject to event-driven dynamics and a physical state subject to time driven dynamics. Based on this framework, we formulate and analyze a class of optimal control problems for single-stage processes. First-order optimality conditions are derived and several properties of optimal state trajectories (sample paths) are identified which significantly simplify the task of obtaining explicit optimal control policies.

AB We are proposing here an approach and a system, called ROBEL, that enables a designer to specify and build a robot supervision system which learns from experience very robust ways of performing a task such as "navigate to". The designer specifies a collection of Hierarchical Tasks Networks (HTN) that are complex plans, called modalities, whose primitives are sensory-motor functions. Each modality is a possible combination these functions for achieving the task. The relationship between supervision states and the appropriate modality for pursuing a task is learned through experience as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) which provides a general policy for the task. This MDP is independent of the environment; it characterizes the robot abilities for the task.

AB This article outlines the research agenda of the Economic and Social Research Council's Growing Older Programme. The Programme focuses on extending quality life and is composed of six sub-themes: defining and measuring quality of life; inequalities in quality of life; technology and the built environment; healthy and productive ageing; family and support networks; and participation and activity in later life. The Programme aims not only to produce high quality research on the factors determining quality in old age and how it can be extended but, also, to contribute constructively to policy and practice. The article also introduces the new UK National Collaboration in Ageing Research which brings together four of the research councils to raise the profile of research on ageing and to develop a multidisciplinary approach.

AB This paper analyses the determinants of travel mode choice for suburbanised commuters in Barcelona, Spain. After describing the importance of residential suburbanisation and the parallel increase in the share of private car use by commuters into the city centre, a nested logit model of transport mode choice is estimated. The results reveal low elasticities, particularly in the case of car commuters. Values of travel time savings are high, although within the ranges obtained in the literature. It is observed that continuing suburbanisation will result in increasing the market share of rail at the expense of the private car use and, mainly, the bus, provided that accessibility to the public transport network is maintained at present levels.

AB A cooperative research center based in Townsville, Australia, has completed almost 6 yrs of applied and strategic research, education, and extension in support of conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. One cornerstone of its success has been the involvement of scientists, representatives from industry, and managers in project development, conduct. and knowledge transfer. Another cornerstone is its interdisciplinary mix of research themes: socioeconomic, technological, and biophysical. We are documenting where, when. and how people currently perceive, use, and benefit from the World Heritage Area and its resources, and how these may change under various future scenarios. We are seeking cost-effective ways for users to meet regulations on structures and wastewater and ballast-water disposal intended to protect the environment. This is done through a combination of critical assessments of the perceived hazard and development of guidelines that reflect that hazard. We are working to evaluate our network of no-take areas in terms of capacity to protect biodiversity and enhance regional fish stocks. We are commencing a parallel socioeconomic impact assessment to took at the effects of different options for closures on fishing communities. Since we will never be able to do biodiversity surveys over more than a small percentage of the entire World Heritage Area, we are developing geographic and physical surrogates to help define 'bioregions' to support planning for the distribution and size of no-take zones. We are linking with catchment scientists to assess the extent of cumulative and individual extreme runoff events. We are using spatial risk-assessment tools to map risks and return periods of impact on coral reefs by unmanageable and/or natural impacts such as floods, cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish, One of the major lessons learned has been that the involvement of research users in the research process has improved 'ownership' of the results of the research, and thus its capacity to effect social change in policy and management areas.

ID NUCLEAR-FUSION; ENERGY-SOURCE
AB At the present state of our information, we can affirm that fusion research, as far as the necessary financial expenditures and their political justification are concerned, is a matter of politically controversial debate. In the political arenas, projects like controlled nuclear fusion are discussed primarily with regard to the controllability of complex technical systems and the sustainability of our future supply of electric power. The attempt to discuss this problem will have to consider: (i) on the one hand. already established concepts of sustainability, (ii) and on the other, the-according to the present state of our knowledge-foreseeable characteristics of a system of power generation and supply based on fusion reactors. Not only do the goals of global technology projects have to be embedded in patterns of universally accepted legitimisation (sustainability), but the organisation of research and development is also changing into networks acting globally. In this sense, globalisation means not only the worldwide linking of financial markets and the permanent availability of information and communication networks, but above all the creation of global organisations of research and innovation processes. The globalisation of research and development of technology has several dimensions: (i) the recognition and treatment of global problems; (iii) the transformation and evolution of new forms of organisation and cooperation in a global community of researchers; (iii) the constitution of Global Change Research. Fusion is playing a 'pathfinder role' for these processes and is at the same time itself an expression of the globalisation of the production of technology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Increasing efforts are being made to address, in public health policy (PHP), both the persistence of nutritional deprivation in economically disadvantaged communities, and the increase in so-called 'chronic disease' (abdominal obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, osteoporosis, arthritides, and inflammatory disease) in communities at all stages of economic development. The problems in the 'chronic disease' descriptor are that its origins may be as early as conception, rather than during the postnatal lifespan, or even in previous generations; it may appear abruptly or slowly; and it may be amenable to environmental and behavioural intervention well into its course and in older age groups. It is also not necessarily 'non-communicable', a qualifier often used for 'chronic disease' (chronic non-communicable disease or CNCD) and often has inflammatory features, for example the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein is a predictor of macrovascular disease and ischaemic events and can, in part, be prevented in the affected by influenzal vaccination. The nexus between immuno-deficiency, inflammatory processes and nutritional status which is characteristic of 'infective' and food-borne illness, is also more and more evident in 'chronic disease'. It may be more helpful to consider chronic disease as 'eco-disease' with its environmental and behavioural contributors, and to regard that which is clearly nutritionally dependent as 'eco-nutritional disease'.

AB Globalization and the advent of the knowledge economy have created a new context where there is a greater demand for the highly skilled, especially in the information technology (IT) industry. High-skilled migration has become increasingly more complex, even if in recent years the term "brain drain" has become a generic reference to "high-skilled migration" of all types. It has also become clear that brain mobility does not automatically translate into "brain drain", and that impacts vary by the types of skills held by migrants.
   The meeting demonstrated that while much is known about high-skilled migration and its effects on source countries, there is also a great deal yet to be learned in a dynamic environment. Many participants deplored the lack of reliable data, which makes it difficult to know what is really going on and to establish appropriate policies. Clearly, there are an array of policies that can offset possible adverse effects of skilled mobility and even leverage the flow into positive outcomes for source countries. A key element is improvement of the population's general level of education. Low levels of skills keep average labour productivity and wages low and therefore retard development. Long-term strategies to promote economic growth are needed to enable developing countries to retain and draw back their highly skilled and address the negative effects of the brain drain. Migrants themselves can play an important role through their remittances, diaspora networks, and own willingness to return-at least temporarily-to share their skills and contribute to economic progress. Finally, destination countries can facilitate the process through policies that promote circulation of highly skilled migrants.

AB International cooperation in the field of contaminated site management has resulted in the formation of collaborations, partnerships and networks. The key benefits of increased cooperation are in the reduction of duplication in efforts, which is of particular importance to industry, in the co-ordination of contaminated site research, improved synergy and definition of needs, policy development, information dissemination and technology transfer. The paper introduces and briefly discusses key collaborations, partnerships and networks throughout the world relating to contaminated site management and remediation. The key value of these partnerships lies in connecting and sharing with them. In addition, the work that these organizations are involved with provides a useful indication of important issues in contaminated site remediation at a global level. The experience shared within these groups should prove useful to the application of similar problems in regions where cooperation has been less evident, such as China and the Asia-Pacific region. This paper has been written for the purpose of providing a resource for workers in the field of contaminated site remediation.

AB So little is known about about what goes on above our heads in rain forests and what lives there that the rain forest 'canopy' has been called the 'last biological frontier'. Until very recently, researchers had very limited access to the canopy, even in temperate forests and, not surprisingly, we are only just beginning to discover this part of the world. A new breed of scientists, canopy biologists, has evolved and have accelerated the rate of discovery. The implications for management of forests of this new voyage of discovery are enormous. At present conservationists, forest managers, environmental policy makers, and other research users have not even started to consider how to integrate the resulting new information for future planning and sustainable management and use of forests.
   The Earth Summit in 1992 drew attention to several of the principal biological dilemmas of the 20th century: biodiversity and forest loss, land conversion, climate change and ozone depletion. Understanding the importance of forest canopies for these issues is essential and researchers need to consider how better to coordinate their activities and deliver their results if they are to influence decision making at all levels. One new initiative shows some promise in this regard. Recently the United Nations Environment Program has supported the International Canopy Crane Network. This network of crane sites around the world will focus on providing an improved scientific basis for the importance of the forest canopy with respect to the Conventions on Biological Diversity, Climate Change and Ozone Depletion.

AB The task of designing and optimizing job scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous computing environments requires the ability to predict scheduling performance. The complexity of heterogeneous scheduling issues requires that the experiments devised to test a scheduling paradigm to be both flexible and extensive. Experimentally determined models for the prediction of job execution times on both sequential and parallel computing resources are combined with the implementation of a novel scheduling algorithm and a software-in-the-loop (SWIL) simulation. The result is a potent design and analysis approach for job scheduling algorithms and implementations intended for heterogeneous environments. This paper develops the concepts, mechanisms, and results of a SWIL design and analysis approach. The merits of this approach are shown in four case studies, which determine overhead, scheduling performance, and the impact of preemption and priority policies. These case studies illustrate the contributions of this research in the form of a new parallel job scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous computing and in the novel application of SWIL simulation to the analysis of job scheduling systems.

AB The U.S. airline industry is facing delays due to congestion problems in the air transportation network. These delays not only lead to increased costs, but they also have safety related implications. Some of the costs related to such delays could be minimized by holding aircraft on the ground at the originating airport when congestion-related delays are expected en route or at the destination airport. Aside from reducing operating costs, the ground holding policy (GHP) also has beneficial implications on some safety concerns, since it is generally felt that it is better to hold an aircraft on the ground than in the air. The GHP is formulated as an integer programming problem and solved using heuristic techniques. However, the presence of discrete and binary integer variables increases the complexity involved when solved using traditional algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GAs) offer a powerful alternative for efficiently solving such problems. A GA is a search and optimization technique based on natural genetics and selection. This paper presents a discussion of GAs and their applicability to evaluating the GHP. Specific examples are presented to illustrate such applications. Results obtained from the test problems are consistent with expectations, indicating that GA can be used as a solution technique. It is observed that the program run time was reasonably low.

AB In 1973, the Korean government initiated a plan to establish a major high-technology research complex, called Daeduck Science Park (DSP). The Ministry of Science and Technology (MST) designated 27 square kilometers of land in Taejon, a city of 1.3 million people (1999) for the creation of the park. By 1998, the DSP had grown to host some 60 institutions employing about 12,000 scientists and technicians, and approximately 5000 support staff. This research note reviews the process involved in developing the DSP, evaluates the outcome of the project, and suggests policy alternatives. Data used were collected from a planning project and from interviews with officials of the MST and the DSP Management Office. It can be concluded that the plan for the DSP was successfully implemented and the guidelines contained in the original plan were well observed. Some problems that emerged in the earlier stages, such as a lack of local economic benefits and political input, are now being corrected. The DSP does provide adequate working and residential environments for those who work for the research and educational institutions that contribute to the advancement of the nation's scientific and technological research.

AB This paper deals with the spread of natural gas as a fuel for motor vehicles. Working on the basis of an input-oriented (and life cycle) approach to environmental issues, it is easy to show that natural gas is often relatively clean in comparison to all the other alternatives. Although natural gas is both cheap and very well suited to motoring uses, natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have not achieved widespread diffusion. This is particularly puzzling in Italy, as the relative price after taxes (in caloric equivalents) of natural gas is about 0.3 against gasoline and 0.4 against diesel fuel. The sample survey conducted confirms not only the practical drawbacks of NGVs - mainly the lack of an adequate refueling network - but also a profound lack of information and knowledge about NGVs characteristics. The overall indication for future policy is that economic incentives alone may not be sufficient. An environmental policy aimed at promoting 'more sustainable' individual choices (NGVs, in this case) must both consider the institutional framework, and promote the initial spread of appropriate understanding and awareness able to prime the endogenous adoption of 'greener' behaviors.

TI Women on waves: Where next for the abortion boat?
SO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
LA English
DT Reprint
DE abortion law and policy; abortion providers and services; Ireland;
   Netherlands
AB Women on Waves was founded to contribute to the prevention of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortions throughout the world by direct action. Because national penal laws, including those governing abortion, generally extend only as far as territorial waters (12 miles), Women on Waves made plans to provide reproductive health services on a ship with a mobile clinic, including abortions, outside the territorial waters of countries where abortion is illegal. We went to Ireland first because it was nearby and there was a dedicated pro-choice community with immediate interest in and commitment to the project. Although we encountered problems that meant we could not do abortions, we were contacted by more than 300 women in five days and provided reproductive health information, contraception, workshops and information on where to obtain legal abortions in Europe. In many parts of the world an anti-abortion backlash is taking place. To safeguard our reproductive rights in the face of anti-abortion activities, it is crucial to recapture a pro-active, pro-choice role. Women on Waves helped to make visible the need for legal abortion services in Ireland, and the extensive class and other differences between women able to access abortions abroad and those who could not. We are currently attempting to resolve our status under Dutch law, but until women everywhere have the right to reproductive freedom, we will continue to make waves. (C) 2001 IPPF European Network.

ID ACCESS; APPROXIMATION; POLICIES
AB The paper compares two alternative hierarchical bandwidth allocation and admission control schemes suited for the multiservice Ka-band satellite environment, where the attenuation of the transmitted signals due to bad weather conditions has a heavy impact on the system's performance. The two schemes are compared by using data derived from a real case study. The aim is to demonstrate that a high level control mechanism for the assignment of the satellite bandwidth to earth stations, which takes into consideration the rain attenuation probabilities of a certain geographical area, improves the system's performance, with respect to an assignment mechanism insensitive to the geographical fade probabilities.

ID RUNOFF
AB An integral methodology to assess performance of riparian ecosystems, based on indicators, was designed and tested. Indicators were constructed from structural components of these ecosystems, The case evaluation results of Tiquio creek, a low order tributary in the Cuitzeo Lake watershed in central Mexico is presented as a study. This methodology was applied at 48 sites along the creek. Results indicate that this stream has highly spatial variable ecological conditions. Degraded sites are found both up and downstream, while preserved sites dominate the middle portion, We concluded that the method has high sensitivity to detect spatial variations of ecological conditions on streams, and is useful for diagnosis and control of watersheds and hydrological networks and so be used to design conservation and management policies.

AB This paper reports on empirical research that investigates the meaning of relationships to owner-managers of small firms, and how differences in meaning are implicated in the strategy of the firms. In-depth interviews with owner-managers yielded 36 usable transcripts. These were coded using a grounded theory approach and the narrative was analysed for differences in meaning. Five categories of orientation to relationships were grounded in the narratives with each firm appearing to have a dominant orientation both with customers and suppliers. A number of apparently common themes in the discourse on relationships, for example, trust, talk, expectations and service, were shown to be interpreted differently, consistent with the types of relationship strategy. We adopted the term strategy because relationships were shown to have a long-term and influential effect, mediated reflexively, on the trajectory of the business. The analysis illustrates the significance of social constructionism and reflexivity as explanatory theories, and therefore the centrality of the meaning of relationships to the strategic management of the firm. Relationships are conceptualized as the mechanism that links the firm to its environment and causal to the impact that change in the environment has on the firm.

AB Realistic population models have interactions between individuals. Such interactions cause populations to behave as systems with nonlinear dynamics. Much population data analysis is done using linear models assuming no interactions between individuals. Such analyses miss strong influences on population behavior and can lead to serious errors-especially for infectious diseases. To promote more effective population system analyses, we present a flexible and intuitive modeling framework for infection transmission systems. This framework will help population scientists gain insight into population dynamics, develop theory about population processes, better analyze and interpret population data, design more powerful and informative studies, and better inform policy decisions. Our framework uses a hierarchy of infection transmission system models. Four levels are presented here: deterministic compartmental models using ordinary differential equations (DE); stochastic compartmental (SC) models that relax assumptions about population size and include stochastic effects; individual event history models (IEH) that relax the SC compartmental structure assumptions by allowing each individual to be unique. IEH models also track each individual's history, and thus, allow the simulation of field studies. Finally, dynamic network (DNW) models relax the assumption of the previous models that contacts between individuals are instantaneous events that do not affect subsequent contacts. Eventually it should be possible to transit between these model forms at the click of a mouse. An example is presented dealing with Cryptosporidium. It illustrates how transiting model forms helps assess water contamination effects, evaluate control options, and design studies of infection transmission systems using nucleotide sequences of infectious agents.

   LITERATURE UPDATE
AB The public health tradition of intervening at the environmental level has not been fully exploited in terms of HIV prevention efforts among drug users. Women who use drugs are at particularly high risk of acquiring HIV and other blood borne and sexually transmitted infections. such as hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV), and could potentially benefit from environmental level interventions. In a review of the existing literature, we examine the extent to which the linkages among multiple causal levels may contribute to the disease transmission risk experienced by women who use drugs. The multiple causal levels of risk potentially involved in the transmission dynamics of infectious pathogens include biological, behavioral, dyadic relationship, network, and structural levels. Biological and behavioral risk factors have already been examined in depth: yet, little empirical research currently exists for other causal levels. Increasingly, investigators suggest that the character and dynamics of relationships with sex partners may be an important determinant of risk, both for engaging in risk behaviors and for doing so with high-risk partners. The influence of higher-order causal level factors, specifically network and structural factors, are the least well documented, but are posited to be a principal underlying cause of the current differential HIV incidence rates between men and women who use drugs. Future research should focus on these higher-order causal levels, in order to better understand disease transmission dynamics. to better evaluate the limitations, as well as the opportunities, of current intervention efforts; to develop interventions that improve and supplement current HIV prevention efforts among women who use drugs: and to inform public policy debate.

AB Price elasticities of transport demand are an important tool to assess the impacts of pricing policies. Empirical research on these elasticities leads to a rather wide range of outcomes. There is obviously a need for a more rigorous methodological framework. This paper provides a new integrative approach to the estimation of price elasticities whilst taking into account any combination of characteristics of transport demand found in various empirical studies. To this end, we apply meta-analysis to this set of studies. From the various modelling approaches that underlie these studies we develop an overlapping general equilibrium framework that provides a meta-regression equation relating the price elasticity estimate to the study characteristics.

AB This paper discusses the role of intelligent agents in facilitating the seeking and retrieval of information in Web-based library environments. An overview is presented on agents and their current application in library domains to produce a generic agent-based model for libraries to follow. The model suggests that Web-based information seeking and retrieval in library contexts could be enhanced through a collaborating network of interface and information agents. Recent research results offer insights on the design of interface agents to support Web-based browsing and searching. These are applied to the model in terms of the functionality required to facilitate information seeking and retrieval behaviour across library collections. implications on library policy and digital collections surrounding the use of agents are also discussed.

AB Based on the Census for Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) 1990, in this paper I will attempt to explain intraurban variations of commuting time and distance in Columbus, OH. Whereas commuting times are directly available from the CTPP, commuting distances are recovered by GIS network techniques as the shortest-time distances through the urban road network. Explanations of commuting are first attempted by measures of job proximity such as distances from employment centers and a gravity-based index accounting for job competition among workers. The influence of employment centers on commuting sheds new light on polycentric urban models. The variation of commuting distance is well explained by the gravity-based job proximity index. That is to say, how far people commute is explainable to a large extent by urban land use. However, how much time people spend on commuting is complicated by their socioeconomic status, which affects their choice of commuting modes. Finally the research demonstrates the promise of explaining commuting times by workers' characteristics such as percentage of black workers, female labor participation ratio, percentage of multiple-worker households, home-ownership status, educational attainment, and wage rate. In the analyses, spatially lagged dependent variables are introduced to control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation.

ID COMPETITION POLICY; TRADE
AB The air transport industry has remained one of the most regulated and restrictive industries in international trade. Domestic deregulation and liberalization have been progressing at an uneven pace across countries, and liberalization of the international markets has yet to overcome numerous obstacles. Air carriers, on the other hand, need to build up an extensive global network to realize economics of scope and density and to meet consumer demands. To accomplish this, they need to have foreign partners. However, ownership restrictions do not allow for cross-country mergers or takeovers. As a result, alliances have become, and will remain in the near future, the primary means for expanding and strengthening airline global service networks. Alliances have provided a way for carriers to mitigate the limitations of bilateral agreements, ownership restrictions, and licensing and control regulations. In effect, both airlines and governments consider international alliances to be the second best solution to achieve free trade in world aviation. This paper discusses regulatory issues related to international airline alliances. Section 1 provides an overview of the current regulations surrounding alliance frameworks, and Section 2 contains a synthesis of economic analysis of regulatory concerns for international airline alliances. Section 3 discusses international coordination in regulations of airline alliances, and Section 4 provides a summary and conclusion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the application of TCP tunnels on the Internet and how Internet traffic can benefit from the congestion control mechanism of the tunnels. Primarily, we show the TCP tunnels offer TCP-friendly flows protection from TCP-unfriendly traffic. TCP tunnels also reduce the many flows situation on the Internet to that of a few flows. In addition, TCP tunnels eliminate unnecessary packet loss in the core routers of the congested backbones, which waste precious bandwidth leading to congestion collapse due to unresponsive UDP flows. We finally highlight that the use of TCP tunnels can, in principle, help prevent certain forms of congestion collapse described by Floyd and Fall [IEEE/ACM Trans Networking 7 (4) (1999) 458].
   The deployment of TCP tunnels on the Internet and the issues involved are also discussed and we conclude that with the recent RFC2309 recommendation of using random early drop as the default packet-drop policy in Internet routers, coupled with the implementation of a pure tunnel environment on backbone networks makes the deployment of TCP tunnels a feasible endeavour worthy of further investigation.

AB This article contributes to the understanding of how symbols can profitably be integrated into a numeric reinforcement learning approach so as to realize a learning robot in a continuous problem setting. An initial experiment clearly revealed that the underlying task could not be learned merely on the basis of numeric reinforcement values. The unstructured utilization of sensory values of the reinforcement approach is dealt with by incorporating readily available domain knowledge. The domain knowledge pre-labels the task space into different regions and builds a connection between the direct sensory experience and the high level features. Teams of networks, each dedicated to a particular feature, exploit the differential characteristics of the regions to rapidly learn the sub-tasks. In addition, a pre-wired fuzzy controller whose function is to restrict the set of actions from which the learner composes a control policy is integrated into the learner. The task faced by the robot has interesting characteristics that are unknown initially, and must be learned. Experimental results indicate that after the robot has been placed in the task space and given the externally motivated needs, it has been able to learn, with a handful of trials, the right policy that fulfills the external needs.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The concepts and visions of sustainable development that have emerged in the post-Brundtland era are explored in terms laying the foundations for a common vision of sustainable urban development (SUD). The described vision and methodology for SUD resulted from the activities of an international network called BEQUEST, funded by the European Commission. The project involved building consensus over the language and vision of SUD across a wide range of stakeholders in the urban environment and across a range of spatial and temporal scales, development activities and environmental and social issues. The resulting vision of SUD is that of a relative, adaptive process in which the current urban fabric is gradually adapted over time to suit more sustainable lifestyles. A framework for structuring information on SUD has been developed which provides a unique, integrated representation of the scope and extent of the subject that links together socio-economic and technical dimensions as well as planning, property, design and construction interests, in time and space. Impediments to implementation of the vision and method are explored, including lack of demand, lack of capacity, absence of agreed targets and indicators together with other policy problems undermining full sustainability assessment and evaluation of urban re/ development proposals.

AB The Republic of Macedonia is undertaking sweeping reforms of its health sector. Funded by a World Bank credit, the reforms seek to improve the efficiency and quality of primary health care (PHC) by significantly strengthening the role of the market in health care provision. On the supply-side, one of the key reform proposals is to implement a capitation payment system for PHC physicians. By placing individual physicians on productivity-based contracts, these reforms will effectively marketize all PHC provision. In addition, the Ministry of Health is considering the sale or concessions of public PHC clinics to private groups, indicating the government's commitment to marketization of health care provision. Macedonia is in a unique position to develop a new role for the private sector in PHC provision. The private provision of outpatient care was legalized soon after independence in 1991; private physicians now account for nearly 10% of all physicians and 22% of PHC physicians. If the reforms are fully realized, all PHC physicians-over 40% of all physicians-will be financially responsible for their clinical practices. This study draws on Macedonia's experience with limited development of private outpatient care starting in 1991 and the reform proposals for PHC, finding a network of policies and procedures throughout the health sector that negatively impact private and public sector provision, An assessment of the effects that this greater policy environment has on private sector provision identifies opportunities to strategically enhance the reforms. With respect to established market economies, the study finds justification for a greater role for government intervention in private health markets in transition economies. In addition to micro-level payment incentives and administrative controls, marketization in Central and Eastern Europe requires an examination of insurance contracting procedures, quality assurance practices, public clinic ownership, referral practices, hospital privileges, and capital investment policies.

AB Designation of grassland sites in the Natura 2000 Network, in application of the Habitats and Birds Directives requires the definition of appropriate management practices, in order to ensure their conservation in a favorable status. Such grasslands present very diverse ecological and agricultural features, even at a local level, as shown by the example from the Lorraine region (France). In most cases, the fertilizer input has to stay very low. The type (cutting or grazing regime or mixed) and intensity level of management will have a determining role on the evolution of these habitats and on their biodiversity. In some cases, management can lead to conflicting effects on different species or communities protected by these Directives. It is then necessary to designate priority target species or communities. In France, surveys are being carried out by experts to determine, for each habitat type and each species of the Habitats and Birds Directives, the management practices required to ensure their conservation in a favorable status.

AB Evidence suggests that place of residence may be associated with smoking independently of individual poverty and socio-economic status, Qualitative research undertaken in disadvantaged communities in Glasgow explored possible pathways which might explain this 'area effect'. A poorly resourced and stressful environment, strong community norms, isolation from wider social norms, and limited opportunities for respite and recreation appear to combine not only to foster smoking but also td discourage or undermine cessation. Even the more positive aspects of life, such as support networks and identity, seem to encourage rather than challenge smoking. Policy and intervention responses need to tackle not only individual but also environmental disadvantage. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Economic organization, innovation systems, and the Internet
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB How can public policy best promote successful innovation in the Internet sector? This paper creates a typology of different types of Internet software firms. Institutions associated with the 'Silicon Valley Model' are a strong driver of success for some key Internet technologies. However, patterns of human-resource development and knowledge management vary widely across Internet technologies, necessitating the development of very different commitments between managers and employees. Institutional frameworks associated with 'organized' economies, such as Germany or Japan, might provide superior tool-kits to help some types of Internet firms to innovate. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the creation of institutional incentives is not the only way to promote patterns of technologically intense innovation associated with Silicon Valley. Technological strategies of dominant firms are often equally important. Regardless of institutional environment, the development of entrepreneurial software firms can be strongly influenced by the activities of large firms working within core network telecommunication technologies.

AB This paper seeks to present a new approach to the implementation of local economic development policies. It takes evidence from such areas as physics, biology, and management theory and proposes that a new 'model' may be the way forward for economic development activities. The new paradigm is based upon research carried out in the Coventry are of the United Kingdom (UK). The paper has a five-part structure. Initially, it will provide an overview of underlying local economic and management trends in the UK. This is followed by an examination of underpinning theories and how these can be used. The third section will report on local economic development agencies (LEDAs) which operate in and around Coventry. The last two sections will draw the strands together to propose an Emergence-based local Economic Development Model.

AB A complex adaptive systems paradigm can be used to abridge theorizing in ecological and economic sciences. The paper discusses economic flows, connectivity and stability from the perspective of theoretical ecology. The global economy, by analogy with ecosystems, appears to self-organize as an ascendent system: most of the world trade is done among the tiny fraction of technologically advanced countries and trade interaction strength exhibits a power law with exponential decay. Small world behavior and preferential attachment characterizes interactions among economic agents. Industrial economics and the world economic system as a whole appear to evolve towards the,maximum power' efficiency. Development that fosters efficiency in the maximum power sense (all the world becomes industrialized) implies a trade-off in socio-economic diversity, and may be antithetical to the stability of the global economy. If we take an ecological perspective, then the problem of global development does not reside in the realm of technology or global governance. It boils down to the question of required natural balance in living systems. the balance between organized complexity and overhead, the harmony between efficiency and adaptability.

AB The Mobius framework is an environment for supporting multiple modeling formalisms and solution techniques. Models expressed in formalisms that are compatible with the framework are translated into equivalent models using Mobius framework components. This translation preserves the structure of the models, allowing efficient solutions. The framework is implemented in the tool by a well-defined abstract functional interface. Models and solution techniques interact with one another through the use of the standard interface, allowing them to interact with Mobius framework components, not formalism components. This permits novel combinations of modeling techniques, and will be a catalyst for new research in modeling techniques. This paper describes our approach, focusing on the "atomic model." We describe the formal description of the Mobius components as well as their implementations in our software tool.

AB Securing the most efficient use of existing road space to maximise the efficient and sustainable movement of people and goods has emerged as one of the key issues for urban transport planners. For over ten years Leeds has been implementing an integrated transport strategy, a central part of which is to secure greater efficiency from the existing road network. This paper outlines these policies and focuses on the practical aspects of reallocating road space and traffic capacity by reference to three different projects in Leeds. The measures discussed cover traffic management in the city centre and priority issues on major radial corridors, including the various approaches being adopted within a' quality bus initiative' on a busy radial corridor. The example of the pioneering A647 scheme is used to show how high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes can not only assist public transport but also benefit motorists.

AB Networks of workstations (NOWs) have become important and cost-effective parallel platforms for scientific computations. In practice, a NOW system is heterogeneous and non-dedicated. These two unique factors make scheduling policies on multiprocessor/multicomputer systems unsuitable for NOWs, but the coscheduling principle is still an important basis for parallel process scheduling in these environments. The main idea of this technique is to schedule the set of tasks composing a parallel application at the same time, to increase their communication performance. In this article we present an explicit coscheduling algorithm implemented in a Linux NOW, of PVM distributed tasks, based on Real Time priority assignment. The main goal of the algorithm is to execute efficiently distributed applications without excessively damaging the response time of local tasks. Extensive performance analysis as well as studies of the parameters and overheads involved in the implementation demonstrated the applicability of the proposed algorithm.

AB A model is presented for residential location choice in rural areas with spatial barriers. We address the problem through comparative static analysis focusing on how residential location choices are affected by a new road link across the spatial barrier. We proceed through a probability theoretical approach: choose a family of utility functions representing every possible location, and equip this family with a probability measure. Then choose a representative within an, equivalence class of utility functions, and represent the probability distribution by a parametrized family of distributions. Our analysis demonstrates that investments in new road links do not necessarily represent an adequate instrument for achieving ambitions in regional policy. We identify reasonable situations where a new road link could just as easily generate net migration from the area. in which the investments are directed. In general, our analysis demonstrates how agglomeration and centralisation tendencies can be considerably affected by transportation infrastructure innovations.

TI Policy recognition in the Abstract Hidden Markov model
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH

ID PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE
AB In this paper, we present a method for recognising an agent's behaviour in dynamic, noisy, uncertain domains, and across multiple levels of abstraction. We term this problem on-line plan recognition under uncertainty and view it generally as probabilistic inference on the stochastic process representing the execution of the agent's plan. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. In terms of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov Model (AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of this network. We then describe an application of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM which allows us to construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this model. In terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model. The Rao-Blackwellised hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the independence properties inherent in a model of plan execution, leading to an algorithm for online probabilistic plan recognition that scales well with the number of levels in the plan hierarchy. This illustrates that while stochastic models for plan execution can be complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited, can lead to efficient plan recognition algorithms. We demonstrate the usefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in a complex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance data.

AB The prevalence of food allergy in European populations has been evaluated at between 1.8 and 4.4 %. In the French population it is 3.24 %. This frequency, as well as the gravity of some manifestations, has already led to preventive and curative measures being taken in school settings. This increase is related to multiple environmental factors : changes in intestinal microflora, early diversification of foods in children, interference of drugs favoring clinical severity in adults. Allergenicity can be modified by food industry techniques. The appearance of novel foods (exotic proteins or those derived from animal feed, and soon GMOs), the growing use of food proteins as ingredients, constitute licit, risks. The absence of validated experimental methods for evaluating the allergic risk of food proteins makes it necessary to implement a policy of allergy vigilance for novel foods. Studies concerning the allergic risk for lupin flour, a new ingredient used in baked goods, are given as an example They indicate the frequency of sensitization and cross peanut-lupin flour allergy, the low, reactive threshold, indicating the risk of the level of incorporation presently allowed. They make possible current screening for this allergy in the population. Allergy vigilance is a recent concept that aims to set ap surveillance of food allergy risks in a manner analogous to that of pharmacovigilance for drugs. A project for creating such a structure is being discussed. Although the central structure remains at the initiative of the Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation (French Agency for Food Safety) and the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (Institute of Health) the authors specify what a peripheral network of allergists should be, analyze the desired content of the bi-directional flow of information, and propose envisaging an intermediate regulatory organization, specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of food allergies. The ongoing idea is that environmental pressures on the genetics of atopic disease lead to a continuum of IgE-dependent responses towards all the potential allergens in the entire population. Consequently, the creation of such a structure is advised in the name of the Precautionary Principle.

AB There has been much discussion of the appropriateness of various organizational strategies for today's healthcare industry This article presents case studies of two healthcare organizations that have pursued very different configurations PennCARE uses a virtually integrated, loose contract-based arrangement, while Henry Ford Health System employs a vertically integrated, tight ownership model Despite these different approaches, their overall designs are strikingly similar In essence both systems demonstrate a property called organizational design consistency, they simply approach it from different ends of the spectrum
   This article presents the notion of organizational design consistency and defines it as the steady pursuit of a single preferred configuration strategy across key elements of organizational design To illustrate the framework the case studies target four key elements of organizational design (governance structure, organizational culture, strategic planning processes, and decision-making procedures) and explain how consistency across these components adds value to both of these differently configured healthcare systems There is room enough for diverse configurations of organizations in the current healthcare environment Consistency does not mandate conformity, value can be derived from both tight and loose models Furthermore, when fashioning organizational design consistency strategies, healthcare systems should carefully choose tightly or loosely modeled configurations to appropriately suit their aims, their markets, and the capabilities and resources available to them.

ID QOS; FRAMEWORK; PLAYOUT
AB In the practical networking environments, an orchestration of distributed multimedia presentation (DMP) with multiple media streams, e.g., WWW multimedia presentations over the Internet, is always disturbed due to the unpredictable end-to-end delay. Presentation adaptation associated with multimedia synchronization and flow control is a feasible solution to achieve a smooth multiple-stream DMP. In the paper, we propose the Pause-And-Run approach for k-stream (PARK) multimedia presentations over Internet to achieve reliable transmission of continuous media. Main characteristics of the PARK approach are as follows. (i) To achieve reliable transmission for continuous media, PARK adopts TCP instead of UDP. (ii) Since the slow-start scheme is embedded in TCP, a novel flow adaptation scheme is proposed to reduce the overhead of the network and end hosts. The server adapts its transmission rates to the buffer situation of the client and prevents the client's buffers from overflow and underflow as much as possible. (iii) With the provision of multiple-stream synchronization and the multi-level adaptation control, the client achieves smooth multimedia presentations and achieves graceful presentation degradation when the resources are insufficient. This paper shows the evaluation of applying the PARK approach over Internet. The evaluation results reveal a suitable buffering control policy for the audio and video media, respectively.

TI The holding problem with real-time information available
SO TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Holding is one of the most commonly used real-time control strategies in transit operations. Given a transit network and its operations plan, the holding problem is to decide at a given time at a control station, which vehicle is to be held and for how long, such that the total passenger cost along the route is minimized over a time period. Previous research on the holding problem has always assumed no real-time information available. Such an assumption not only poses great difficulties in solving the problem, but also Limits practical applications in a real-time, dynamic operations environment. In this paper we formulate the holding problem as a deterministic quadratic program in a rolling horizon scheme, and develop an efficient solution algorithm to solve it. Using headway data collected by an automated system, we tested the algorithm and evaluated the impact of the resulting holding policies. Important and interesting properties of the holding solution, obtained from both theoretical and computational analyses, are presented.

AB Citing recent case study evidence from various parts of Africa, this article argues that the income diversification efforts of most rural dwellers over the past decade have been directed at meeting daily needs amidst declining returns to commercial agriculture. Individuals and households have experimented with new forms of livelihood, expanding their non-agricultural income sources, while retaining their base in subsistence farming. Various livelihood patterns are emerging, depending on historical, geographical and agro-ecological factors at local and national levels. Livelihood experimentation has catalysed overlapping arenas of dynamic change, notably disequilibria between households and individual members, tensions between generations, the recalibration of gender power balances, and a search for new social networks. So far this surge of livelihood 'multiplexity' has not generated adequate overall levels of gainful employment, technical innovation, purchasing power or welfare improvement. Thus, probing the complex interplay of economic, social, cultural and political dynamics in rural Africa becomes all the more essential for effective policy formulation.

AB The paper sets out a fresh approach to healthy workplaces, laying foundations to meet the demands of the new millennium. Professionals such as occupational hygienists deal with issues at the heart of the economy and society, which are beginning to attract the attention of politicians. Old disciplinary barriers must be crossed and communication improved so that healthy work is accepted as a mainstream concern, integral to sustainable development. This presents challenges both to professionals and to those with responsibilities for policy. As a first step, we need to develop an understanding of how conclusions from research can inform responsible decision making. We will not be able to design and build perfectly safe environments, but real progress can be made in the field of 'workplace health defence', using available human, technical and financial resources. A vital ingredient is partnership in the workplace, involving social partners and professionals working in collaboration.

AB The health care systems in Canada and Finland are currently in the process of restructuring. Responsibility for care has increasingly shifted to ill persons themselves and to their families and friends. Reduced hospital stays, service privatization and user fees have been implemented to some degree in both countries. These changes are reverberating throughout Finnish and Canadian societies, affecting not only users of health care but also the labour force in health workplaces.
   Health social workers, at the front line with clients, have experienced new issues which have impacted on their practice with ill persons and their families. In an environment of health care restructuring, they have needed to draw upon their repertoires of knowledge, skills and community networks in order to respond. At the same time, social workers noted that there is a leaner package of health and social service benefits to support patients and families. Social workers have tried to adapt and find new opportunities to practice social work in the changed environment.
   This small study, initially conducted as a pilot for a larger study, compared the experiences of social workers in Canada and Finland and the perceived impacts of health restructuring on their clients. The findings, seen within the context of changing societal and institutional environments, can help us to better understand some of the impacts of health restructuring on social work and social workers in hospitals and local health centres. Indirectly and directly, these changes also affect clients in the health care system, those whose needs remain uppermost in the delivery of social work services. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

ID MULTIMARKET COMPETITION; DIVERSIFICATION; DYNAMICS
AB The so-called information revolution has loosened many tongues in the academic, business and policy worlds. The communis opinio is that the diffusion of modern information technologies in the global village is about to radically change the rules of the competitive game in many, if not all, industries. What the new rules may be, nobody really knows for sure. The New Economy, being characterized by the penetration of information technologies and the dominance of network arrangements, is born. Finns face the daunting task of developing a response to this new environment. How they respond depends in part on what they learn from their contact portfolio. Which contacts they have, and what information they get out of these contacts, shapes their response to the New Economy. A case in point is the Internet. Apart from stimulating the emergence of new value-adding products and efficiency-enhancing processes, an argument is that the Internet will shake lip the century-old market institution by introducing information transparancies and network, economies. This chapter's objective is fivefold. First, we summarize the current state of the art in the multimarket competition literature. Second, we develop a multichannel contact,framework that builds upon the established multimarket contact theory. Third, we briefly evaluate the New Economy debate. Fourth, we analyze What the emergence of this New Economy may imply for issues of competitive rivalry and strategic management in the context of multichannel contact management. Fifth, we illustrate part of the argument by briefly discussing the case of Java software.

AB Aim Climate change has the potential to have significant impacts on the distribution of species and on the composition of habitats. This paper identifies the potential changes in the future distribution of species under the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios, in order that such changes can be taken into account in conservation management.
   Location The model was applied to Britain and Ireland.
   Methods A model based on an artificial neural network was used to predict the changing bioclimate envelopes of species in Britain and Ireland. Fifty-four species representing 15 habitats were modelled.
   Results The modelled species could be placed into three categories: those losing suitable climate space, those gaining it, and those showing little or no change. When the species were associated with habitats it was found that Arctic-Alpine/montane heath communities were the most sensitive to climate change, followed by pine woodland and beech woodland in southern England. In lowland heath, wet heath, cereal field margins, coastal grazing marsh, drought-prone acid grassland and calcareous grassland, the species either showed little change or an increase in suitable climate space. The other eight habitats showed a mixed response.
   Conclusions The species show a variety of responses to climate change and thus their current habitat associations may alter. The uncertain future of some species and habitats is highlighted. Conservation policy and practice will need to be revised in the face of climate change.

AB Massive bleaching was observed in various reefs throughout the Philippines (5-21 degreesN. 116-128 degreesE), beginning early June until late November 1998. Satellite-derived SST data from NOAA/NESDIS was used to examine thermal anomalies ('hotspots') observed in the country during this same period. Anecdotal reports from the Coral Reef Information Network of the Philippines (PhilReefs) partners revealed the extent of bleaching in other parts of the country. The observations coincided with the occurrence of a hotspot over the region. Coral community studies detected significant decrease in live coral cover (up to 46%) and increase in dead coral cover (Lip to 49%). The results support the hypothesis that elevated sea temperatures was the major cause of the bleaching event. Some patterns of susceptibility within and across reefs, possibly due to influences of factors such as wave energy, tidal fluctuations and reef morphology, were also observed. The extent and scale of the 1998 bleaching events in the Philippines could not be fully attributed to small-scale anthropogenic disturbances directly affecting reefs since severe bleaching was also observed in offshore reefs. Its coincidence with the El Nino-related temperature anomalies suggests that the interaction between human-induced and natural factors behind bleaching remains to be investigated further. This interaction is critical for reef recovery and the discrimination between both impacts can be useful for policy and decision-making processes in management.

ID JUSTICE; RACE
AB In the US, there are two primary environmental justice arenas. One is the activism, which draws on the skills of a wide range of community, academic and professional actors. This partnership draws on the Civil Rights Movement and organises through the internet. The other arena is the courtroom where environmental justice lawyers try to prove 'racial intent'. In the UK, there is an emerging call for environmental justice, but there is no comparable Civil Rights movement, just a well-organised if very unrepresentative environmental movement. However, in the UK, it is possible to discern at least three 'constructions' of environmental (in)justice: access to the countryside amongst those from ethnic minority groups; Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland's 'Pollution Injustice' campaign and Friends of the Earth Scotland's 'Campaign for Environmental Justice'. In the absence of a UK Civil Rights framework, there are indications that environmental and sustainability policy discourses are beginning to be re-framed around notions of justice, rights and equity. This is beginning to form a platform around which an embryonic environmental justice network is mobilising.

AB Pesticide Action Network North America (PANNA) collaborated with a local Indonesian nongovernmental organization (NGO), Yayasan Duta Awam (YDA), in monitoring impacts of the World Bank-financed Integrated Swamps Development Project (ISDP). This paper reports the results of the community-based investigation, which found wide disparities between the World Bank's policy on pest management and its implementation. Instead of reducing farmers' reliance on pesticides as required, the ISDP led to increased intensity and frequency of pesticide use and adverse health and environmental effects from pesticide exposures. YDA and PANNA presented the findings to the Indonesian government and World Bank officials, and farmers requested training in IPM among other recommendations. After NGOs undertook joint advocacy efforts to reduce pesticide dependence in the project, the World Bank withdrew hazardous pesticides from input packages, IPM training was initiated, and community monitors became local leaders in their villages. The study demonstrates the importance and efficacy of independent community-based monitoring in documenting pesticide problems and replacing pesticides with IPM in World Bank development projects.

ID NETWORK SIMULATION
AB As the most widely used reliable transport in today's Internet, TCP has been extensively studied in the past decade. However, previous research usually only considers a small or medium number of concurrent TCP connections. The TCP behavior under many competing TCP flows has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to systematically investigate the performance of a large number of concurrent TCP flows. We start with a simple scenario, in which all the connections have the same roundtrip time (RTT), and the gateways use drop-tail policy. We examine how the aggregate throughput, goodput, and loss rate vary with different underlying topologies. We also look at the behavior of each individual connection when competing with other connections. We observe global synchronization in some cases. We break the synchronization by either adding random processing time or using random early detection (RED) gateways, and examine their effects on the TCP performance. Finally we investigate the TCP performance with different RTTs, and quantify the roundtrip bias using both analysis and simulations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As multinational enterprises increasingly globalize their operations, managing international human resources strategically becomes a critical factor contributing to overall organizational performance. The strategic management of international human resources has received extensive attention, focusing on staffing issues related to expatriate assignments. However, empirical findings indicate limited success of expatriation as an effective method for managing the breadth of international human resource opportunities. As market opportunities increasingly shift to countries with high cultural distance from the parent organization and as organizations evolve their strategic orientation from multinational to global activities, it appears that an exclusive reliance on expatriation-based staffing will impede effective management of international human resources staffing. The objective of this article is to review and clarify a theory base that can support a range of international human resource staffing systems that might be implemented in a global environment. This discussion uses the combined perspective of agency and expectancy theories and discusses conditions under which specific strategic staffing choices might be most effective.

TI Simulating the effects of railroad mergers
SO SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID RATES; DEREGULATION; COMPETITION; GRAIN
AB The purpose of this paper is to add to the empirical literature regarding merger simulation analysis by examining the effect of railroad mergers on railroad market power. This is done by measuring railroad profits and revenue/variable cost ratios corresponding to different degrees of intrarailroad competition for movements of Kansas export wheat to Houston, Texas.
   Two models are developed to achieve the objectives of the study. A network model of the wheat logistics system is used to identify the least cost transportation routes from the Kansas study area to the market at Houston. A profit improvement algorithm, which identifies Nash equilibrium prices, is developed to measure the amount by which railroads can profitably raise their prices above variable cost.
   The results of the study have implications for U.S. railroad merger policy. The paper indicates that railroad mergers do not necessarily increase railroad market power or make railroad shippers worse off. Instead, the study demonstrates that the impact of railroad mergers on shippers and railroads depends on factors that vary geographically, such as the degree of intrarailroad and intermodal competition in the area.

   PRIORITIZATION
AB In low earth orbit (LEO) mobile satellite system, handoff is a prominent issue that originates from satellite constellation movement. For the purpose of quality of service provision, handoff is always intentionally protected to avoid call connection from service interruption. Generally speaking, the handoff protection strategies proposed for use in terrestrial cellular systems are also applicable in satellite environment, but a drawback of these schemes is loss of system capacity. This. paper mathematically evaluates the impact on LEO system capacity by channel reservation, which is one of the handoff protection strategies suitable for satellite environment. Based on the findings, a Best Effort Admission scheme is investigated in mobile satellite systems to improve channel utilization. A Dynamic Channel Reservation scheme is also proposed for the nonuniformly distributed global traffic demand that makes adaptive channel reservation decision according to local traffic load condition. As suitability of channel reservation varies with traffic load, this dynamic policy provides satisfactory level of service quality at light loaded locations, whereas system capacity will be emphasized at heavy loaded locations.

SO RISK ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE hazardous materials; transportation; risk; equity; Geographic
   Information Systems; large-scale implementation
AB This article presents a methodology for assessment of the hazardous materials transport risk in a multicommodity, multiple origin-destination setting. The proposed risk assessment methodology was integrated with a Geographical Information System (GIS), which made large-scale implementation possible. A GIS-based model of the truck shipments of dangerous goods via the highway network of Quebec and Ontario was developed. Based on the origin and destination of each shipment, the risk associated with the routes that minimize (1) the transport distance, (2) the population exposure, (3) the expected number of people to be evacuated in case of an incident, and (4) the probability of an incident during transportation was evaluated. Using these assessments, a government agency can estimate the impact of alternative policies that could alter the carriers' route choices. A related issue is the spatial distribution of transport risk, because an unfair distribution is likely to cause public concern. Thus, an analysis of transport risk equity in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario is also provided.

AB To help integrated natural resource management (INRM) research "deliver the goods" for many of the world's poor over a large area and in a timely manner, the authors suggest a problem-solving approach that facilitates the scaling out of relevant agricultural practices. They propose seven ways to foster scaling out: (1) develop more attractive practices and technologies through participatory research (2) balance supply-driven approaches with resource user demands, (3) use feedback to redefine the research agenda, (4) encourage support groups and networks for information sharing, (5) facilitate negotiation among stakeholders, (6) inform policy change and institutional development, and (7) make sensible use of information management tools, including models and geographic information systems (GIS). They also draw on experiences in Mesoamerica, South Asia, and southern Africa to describe useful information management tools, including site similarity analyses, the linking of simulation models with GIS, and the use of fanner and land type categories.

AB Following almost two years' field practice, substantial study and discussion a cohort of Educational Psychologists in Training (EPITs) (N = 11) shared their perspectives about the current challenges for EPs. Their written accounts were analysed by way of qualitative research methods which represented a discrete learning experience for the EPITs. Data analysis suggested that the 'challenge' for EPs and their services was to adopt an 'ecological' or 'systemic' orientation to educational psychology with an emphasis on naturalistic practitioner-research methods. 'Challenges' and their 'barriers' were construed to be 'internally' and 'externally' determined leading, in theory, to either 'change' or 'status quo' in regard to EPs' practice. Legislation, educational and social policies were identified as external challenges which could be appropriately met by EPs' consensus on service aims, an agreed practice model, continued professional development, awareness and understanding of 'change' and how to manage it, and opportunities for professional exchanges through national networks of EPs. The limitations of the enquiry in terms of generalizability were considered. EP publications, both contemporary and historical, were found to provide converging evidence for the data.

AB Recently emerging evidence indicates that some gay men/men who have sex with men (MWHSWM) are continuing to engage in unsafe sexual practices despite over a decade of health education/promotion. Accordingly, there have been recent attempts to 'revamp' health education/promotion programmes as a means of encouraging participation. One way of doing this has been through government facilitation of 'community' based health promotion programmes. These programmes attempt to regenerate social networks and supportive environments and to thereby empower gay men/MWHSWM. This paper explores some of the issues involved in this: process in relation to an independent evaluation of a government funded community based health promotion project set up in the north-west of England. Drawing on interviews and focus groups with clients and agencies involved with the project, it explores some of the connections and conflicts between empowerment, safer sex and government funded health promotion interventions.

AB Research on access tends to focus on descriptive indicators characterizing need. Other attributes such as behavior and attitudes however may also play central roles. This paper explores the influence of descriptive (e.g., sociodemographic characteristics, residential location, and physical health) and behavioral (e.g., social network interaction and mobility) variables on service use using a recent survey of persons living with HIV or AIDS in Orange County, California. Services are divided into two types: medical care (providing medication and regular examinations associated with HIV and AIDS) and human services (providing mental health care and meeting basic needs such as food, clothing, and housing). The analysis indicates that nor having medical coverage was strongly associated with greater use of public medical services, and that self-reported disability and bring reliant on a friend for transportation were strongly associated with greater use of human and supportive sen ices. Implications of these results are presented for policy and future research.

AB The MOMBASA Software Environment is a toolkit that implements mobility-related functionalities complementing multicast protocols for multicast-based mobility support. The functionalities provided by the MOMBASA Software Environment include detection of link availability, registration, location update, paging, address translation, handoff initiation, handoff control, rerouting, prevention of handoff oscillation and inactive handoff suppression.
   The MOMBASA Software Environment is targeted for researchers investigating the support of host mobility in IP-based cellular networks. It aims at performance evaluation of mobility support by means of measurements. The software is easy to maintain, to configure and to extend: a) It has a clear design, b) it provides well-defined configuration and management interfaces, c) policies can be used to control and tune the system behavior and d) it has a generic interface to the multicast which facilitates to investigate multicast protocols of different types.
   This paper describes the functionalities, features and structure of the MOMBASA Software Environment and presents a framework for evaluating the performance of mobility support using the MOMBASA Software Environment. The MOMBASA Software Environment is open software under GNU Public License. It is freely available, extensively tested and well documented.

AB The production strategies of transnational corporations (TNCs) have revolutionized the structure of global port and container shipping industries as both have adopted information and communication technology (ICT) to better articulate the spatial movement of goods between producing and consuming regions. This research first explores the structural synergies between TNC production, ICT and container transport. With in the context of "developmental state" policies, the bulk of the paper examines the rise of Singapore as an ICT-based global container hub to serve the simultaneous processes of spatial agglomeration and dispersion associated with regional TNC production strategies. The aggressive adoption of ICT by the Singapore Port Authority (PSA) enabled the city-state to territorially embed and competitively manage trade flows through a complex, but spatially flexible hub and spoke geometry of container movements. Through the process of "glocalization", the PSA has itself become a TNC by operating container terminals around the world. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Today, managing diversity is considered one of the main challenges for HRM in modern organizations. In this article, a framework is developed to suggest that the design and implementation of HRM activities should be influenced by strategic choices on the management of diversity which are themselves shaped by environmental factors. The HRM activities lead to four types of outcomes (affective, cognitive, symbolic and communicative) that affect individual, group and organizational performance. This framework is used to explore the effects of workforce diversity in two cases and to provide answers to three central questions: how does diversity influence the interactions in and the performance of diverse groups, and what is the relation between management diversity and other HRM policies in the two companies? The findings indicate that an organization's strategy for managing diversity influences both the process of meaning formation regarding diversity and the perception of performance effects. The availability of an organizational vocabulary and of instruments to interpret interactions in terms of diversity make a crucial difference. The stories and incidents from the two cases show how diversity affects both the daily interactions and the functioning of diverse groups.

AB Potentially unlimited computing power is provided today by computing facilities available via the Internet. Unfortunately, the facilities exhibit a variety of non-uniform interfaces to the users. Each facility has its own operating system, its own policy with respect to access and accounting, its own set of tools, and its own data. To utilize the computing power, a user has to select an appropriate facility, and has to know how to access and operate the facility, which tools to use, what options to provide for these tools, how to execute tools, how to submit a job for execution, etc..
   The Superbroker infrastructure gives easy access to HPCN facilities in the Netherlands through a web browser, thereby taking care of the networking and system details. The user is provided with a single working environment, which gives easy access to the available, usually remote resources as if they were present on a single computer (a "metacomputer"). Using the desktop's native software only, the user can easily browse the working environment, start tools, and submit jobs using point-and-click and drag-and-drop operations. The working environment may be tailored for particular end users and application areas. This paper presents the design and implementation of the infrastructure.

AB This paper reports the results of a study undertaken to explain levels of implementation of heart health promotion activities observed in Ontario public health agencies in 1997. Organizational-level data were collected by surveying all 42 health departments in 1994, 1996 and 1997 as part of the Canadian Heart Health Initiative Ontario Project. Guided by social ecological and organizational theories, the model examines relationships between implementation and four sets of possible determinants of activity: (1) the predisposition of agencies to undertake heart health promotion activities, (2) their capacity to undertake these activities, (3) internal organizational factors and (4) external system factors. A small set of five variables explains almost half of the variance in implementation (R-2 = 0.46): organizational capacity (beta = 0.40), priority given to heart health (beta = 0.36), coordination of programs (beta = 0.19), use of resource centers (beta = 0.12) and participation in networks (beta = 0.09). The results suggest that models integrating organizational and socio-ecological theories can help us understand the implementation of community-based heart health promotion activities by public health agencies. Implications for future research, policy and practice are discussed.

AB The absence of social well-being and growing vulnerability are alarming for a large portion of people living in the Balkan countries. The Stability Pact is currently targeting the issue of social cohesion, which-holds out promise for as yet unrealized development. Both the World Health Organization and the Council of Europe have called attention to the population vulnerability and growing disparity in health status between that region and Europe. Reversal of present trends demands the support of the international community and the strengthening of all public health institutions, human resource training, and population health research. Given the severity of the "problem space" of population vulnerability, these actions are more than ever indispensable to the health sector of the region. The paper describes an encouraging dialogue for Balkan health conducted by the National School of Public Health in Athens, Greece over the past decade and emphasizes the work of the newly created Public Health in South Eastern Europe (PH-SEE) Network (www.snz.hr/ph-see), which provides new opportunities for engagement in regional public health through Public Health Schools and Institutes. There is a need for public health curricula development and a closer linkage of all Schools with the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region. A curriculum for peace and public health is already under development in institutions in Athens, Greece; Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Zagreb, Croatia. Soon to be added to the group of regional institutions is the School of Public Health in Skopje. It is a policy response to considerable need in a country showing pre-conflict conditions in the heart of the South Eastern Europe. Within the general framework of public health development, a School of Public Health in Skopje can be of great national benefit. Suggestions are made for its function under an umbrella of interdisciplinarity and autonomy, and the need to steer a path clear of medical dominance. According to a related mission statement, the School is to be implemented as an academic center of excellence and innovation, with the worthy purpose of improving the health of the population, with particular attention to the disadvantaged, underserved, and vulnerable. It can aid policy enactment, capacity building, and vulnerability research, promote the development of new training curricula for human rights and public health, and contribute to regional public health. The implementation of the School has a symbolism attached to it as a Balkan response for the elimination of the causes for political violence.

ID COMPUTER NETWORK; FILE ALLOCATION
AB In today's distributed manufacturing environment, how to manage the product data and distributing it to the right people who need it is critical to the success of a company. A distributed product data management (DPDM) system is thus required to manage product data distribution and product data integrity throughout the product life cycle. In this paper, a product data object is the logical unit of distribution in a DPDM system. Replication and migration techniques are discussed and employed in object distribution. Since the allocation of an object in a distributed manufacturing environment is a critical issue in a DPDM system, an optimal object allocation policy is needed. Therefore, object allocation objectives for DPDM are set to facilitate object replication and migration decision making. A comprehensive mathematical modeling approach is developed for product data object distribution within a DPDM system. Also, a distributed object-oriented database architecture is proposed for the DPDM system's use. Object-oriented databases were proposed to meet the needs of advanced technical applications, such as CAD/CAM, CAE, etc. where most of these applications are also run in a distributed environment.

TI Building the sustainable community: Is social capital the answer?
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PLACE
AB Over the past decade, environmental sustainability has emerged as a prominent theme in the community development literature. In fact, the concept has become a standard feature of most economic and social development plans. Most models of sustainable community development stress the importance of widespread participation in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, community studies document numerous barriers to broad involvement and the high level of activeness envisioned by proponents of sustainable community development. In searching for ways to overcome these barriers, scholars and policymakers have embraced the idea that we can enhance efforts to create more sustainable communities by increasing the local stock of social capital. We examine this line of reasoning in light of what we view as the most important conceptual issues surrounding the relationship between social capital and sustainable community development. We conclude that before social capital is endorsed as a central component of public policy, much work remains to be done in terms of developing a more precise definition of the concept, situating it within extant theories of community, constructing better measures of social capital, documenting the activities and networks most important in building social capital, and gaining a better understanding of the forms of social capital that are most important in developing sustainable communities.

TI Legal deposit and preservation of digital publications: A review of
   research and development activity
SO JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION
LA English
DT Review
AB The aim of legal deposit is to ensure the preservation of and access to a nation's intellectual and cultural heritage over time. There is a global trend towards extending legal deposit to cover digital publications in order to maintain comprehensive national archives. However, including digital publications in legal deposit regulations is not enough to ensure the long-term preservation of these publications. Indeed, there are many practical difficulties associated with the entire deposit process. Concepts. principles and practices that are accepted and understood in the print environment, such as publication, publisher, place of publication and edition, may have new meanings or no longer be appropriate in a networked environment. Mechanisms for identifying. selecting and depositing digital material either do not exist or are inappropriate for some kinds of digital publication. There is a great deal of work on developing digital preservation strategies, this is it an early stage. National and other deposit libraries are at the forefront of research and development in this area, often in partnership with other libraries, publishers and technology vendors. Most of this activity is of a technical nature. There is some work oil developing policies and strategies for managing digital resources. However, not all management issues or users' needs are being addressed.

AB Some of the major themes developed in the sociology of mental health and in psychiatry are presented here specifically from the point of view of how the family has been perceived over the 20th century. Historically, the family was initially considered the "cause" of mental health problems. Today, in the age of psychiatric desinstitutionalization, it has become a "solution" for keeping patients in their natural living environment. Thus, a major paradigm shift has occurred in going from a pathological model of the family to that of qualified caregiver. With a critical eye, the author presents the stages that have operated this transformation. The family's long journey through the past 100 years will take us to the two topics of research most frequently explored today, namely, caregiver burden and expressed emotion. What we know about families that care for a severely mentally disordered loved one at home remains very limited, however, and the dynamics between families and professionals continue to be characterized by a certain animosity. Even though it is considered a key element in the policy aimed at caring for patients in the community, the family is still only in part recognized as a potentially positive source of influence in the treatment trajectory.

AB This article sets out to rethink the dynamics of the migratory process under conditions of globalization. Two main models of migration and incorporation dominated academic and policy approaches in the late twentieth. century: first, the settler model, according to which immigrants gradually integrated into economic and social. relations, re-united or formed families and eventually became assimilated into the host society (sometimes over two or three generations);. second, the temporary migration model, according to which migrant workers stayed in the host country for a limited period, and maintained their affiliation with their country of origin. Globalization, defined as a proliferation of cross-border flows and transnational networks, has changed the context for migration. New technologies of communication and:transport allow frequent and multi-directional flows of people, ideas and, cultural symbols. The erosion of nation-state sovereignty and autonomy weakens systems of border-control and migrant assimilation. The result is the transformation of the material and cultural practices associated with migration and community formation, and the blurring of boundaries between different categories of migrants. These trends will be illustrated through case-studies of a number of Asian and European immigration countries. It is important to re-think our understanding of the migratory process, to understand,new forms of mobility and incorporation, particularly the emergence of transnational communities, multiple identities and multi-layered citizenship.

AB Objective: The management of inter-agency collaborations needs to be approached in particular, but not well defined, ways. In this paper the management and ways of working of a successful co-ordinating unit are discussed and located in the context of inter-agency partnerships.
   Methods: The text is based on qualitative archival research and a critical review of practice.
   Conclusions: The evidence indicates that the agencies participating in the centre valued its work in facilitating inter-agency collaboration. The structural arrangements of the centre, and its modus operandi, manifest the characteristics of an 'obligational co-ordinating unit' in which success is based on establishing and maintaining appropriate interactions between partner agencies. The ways the centre operationalised the key principles of independence, member support, power and trust relations are discussed. Finally, the importance of 'environmental fit' and the impact of a changing policy environment on the centre are discussed.
   Implications: In health promotion, and public health more broadly, efforts to co-ordinate the work of agencies and their members are common. However, the precise structures and work practices that are effective rarely have a foundation in evidence or theory. This paper will contribute to our knowledge of how the work of co-ordination can be effectively undertaken in the context of agencies voluntarily entering negotiated relationships to pursue joint goals in public health.

AB As the Internet evolves from a packet network supporting a single best effort service class towards an integrated infrastructure supporting several service classes-some with QoS guarantees-there is a growing interest in the introduction of admission control and in devising bandwidth sharing strategies, which meet the diverse needs of QoS-assured and elastic services. In this paper we show that the extension of the classical multi-rate loss model is possible in a way that makes it useful in the performance analysis of a future admission control based Internet that supports traffic with peak rate guarantee as well as elastic traffic. After introducing the model, it is applied for the analysis of a single link, where it sheds light on the trade-off between blocking probability and throughput. For the investigation of this trade-off, we introduce the throughput-threshold constraint, which bounds the probability that the throughput of a traffic flow drops below a predefined threshold. Finally, we use the model to determine the optimal parameter set of the popular partial overlap link allocation policy: we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that provides blocking probability- and throughput guarantees. We conclude that the model and the numerical results provide important insights in traffic engineering in the Internet. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Africa is a region of diverse migration circuits relating to origin, destination and transit for labour migrants, undocumented migrants, refugees and brain circulation of professionals.
   This article outlines major migration configurations in the region, and the role of two vibrant subregional organizations - Economic Community of West African States and South African Development Community- in facilitating, containing or curtailing intra-regional migration which takes place within diverse political, economic, social and ethnic contexts; the transformation of brain drain into brain circulation; and commercial migration in place of labour migration within the region.
   Despite overlapping membership, wavering political support, a poor transportation network, border disputes and expulsions, these subregional organizations are crucial for the region's collective integration into the global economy, and to enhance economic growth and facilitate labour intra-regional migration.
   Free movement of persons without visa, adoption of ECOWAS travellers' cheques and passports, the creation of a borderless Community; and the granting of voting rights and later citizenship and residence permits by South Africa to migrant workers from SADC countries are positive developments.
   These organizations need to foster cooperation between labour-exporting and recipient countries, implement the protocols on the right of residence and establishment; promote dialogue and cooperation in order to harmonize, coordinate and integrate their migration policies as envisioned by the 1991 Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community.

TI Protecting critical information infrastructures
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
LA English
DT Article
AB As governments and corporations learn to operate in the Information Age environment, it is becoming ever more evident that the Information Society will not progress unless it is built on secure foundations. The dependability and robustness of large scale networked information systems is already a cause for concern but the rapid growth of E-business and E-government, which are critically dependent on these infrastructures, has placed trustworthiness firmly onto the corporate and political agenda.
   However, devising policies to protect critical information infrastructures will require not only new thinking but also new modes of partnership across sectors and across borders. Ways need to be found of engaging all actors, and encouraging thrill to work together to secure information infrastructures through enlightened self-interest.
   This paper explores the complex requirements of partnership, ill the hope that an understanding of the issues carl help stakeholders in the Information Society to better protect themselves and their logical neighbours. The 'information revolution' is centred around the drive to research, develop, produce and exploit advanced Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Key technological developments include the digitization of information, the widespread penetration of computing, increases in computing power, the merging of computing with telecommunications and increases in bandwidth that enable ubiquitous networking. Taken together, these developments ill information gathering, processing. storage, retrieval and dissemination provide the technological underpinnings for the emergence of Information Societies in which the nature and role and information are radically different from the Cast.
   As with previous technological 'revolutions', technology itself is not necessarily the primary variable leading to change. Rather, the organizational, conceptual and doctrinal impacts of the technologies provide the medium by which technological change translates into wider social change.
   For commerce, a decade of back office automation is giving way to a drive to automate the front-end, both between businesses and between business and the consumer. The network effect and the highly competitive nature of this type of business are driving the revolution onwards.
   For governments, the information revolution makes possible the modernization of government, hence in the UK, the Blair government's drives for "joined-up government" and "government.direct."(2) The notion is that both the core businesses of central government and the services delivered to the public can be enhanced by the adoption of networked technologies supported by appropriate procedures and structures.
   This 'information revolution' has a number of security implications:
   . Nation states, economies and citizens are becoming ever more reliant on Networked Information Systems (NIS) which are vulnerable to attack. As dependence increases, so the results of attacks become potentially more disruptive. The nature of these systems and the possible modes of cyber-attack, meanwhile, mean that the capability of carrying out attacks is proliferating and that it is tremendously difficult to identify attackers and to distinguish between electronic vandals at one end of the spectrum and nation state aggressors at the other.
   . Economic globalization, the proliferation of information technologies and developments in the global media mean that, on the one hand, it is increasingly hard for states to impose controls on the media to which their citizens are exposed. On the other, arguably, it is increasingly easy for states or groups to use propaganda, disinformation or psychological operations in order to achieve their strategic, political or economic goals.
   . The information revolution land other strategic pressures on Western armed forces) is leading to a Revolution in military affairs. This involves the exploitation of advanced technologies to develop new doctrines, organizations and modes of war that allow conventional armed forces to be smaller, more lethal, operate at a higher tempo and to react more rapidly over long distances.(3)

AB The Traffic Emission Modelling and Mapping Suite (TEMMS) is a program designed to provide detailed estimates of vehicle emissions on urban road networks, and so act as a precursor to urban air quality modelling. TEMMS is a module of the "Quantifiable City", a more extensive model designed to address questions relevant to urban sustainability. Within the Quantifiable City model, TEMMS interfaces with SATURN, a traffic assignment model, and the Airviro or ADMS-Urban pollutant dispersion models, to calculate spatially defined pollutant concentrations for given traffic, meteorological and stationary source emission inputs. TEMMS also contains an integral model, ROADFAC, which calculates emissions of gases and particulates from vehicles using SATURN traffic or vehicle count data. TEMMS integrates these models via a database exchanger, the MapInfo geographic information system, and a custom-built Windows-based graphical user interface, allowing modelling and mapping of link-based vehicle flow and emissions, and grid-based air quality. TEMMS applications include emission and air quality mapping, evaluation of associated transport policies and scenarios, and preparation of inputs to other (e.g., epidemiological) models. Within this context, TEMMS has generated considerable interest from potential end-users in Local Authorities and air quality management support services. Validation of the integrated model is discussed, and an example application of TEMMS to a large UK city presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Kosovo war of 1999 brought the checkered legacies of Russian and Western geopolitics back to the forefront of international relations. Central to the discussions of the Balkans is its century-old legacy as a Shatterbelt or Crush Zone. Though not identified by Saul Cohen as a Shatterbelt during the Cold War, the region is now located where the maritime (Western) and land power (Russian) geostrategic realms come into contact. NATO expansion and Russian insecurities about the region's future have revised interest in geopolitical linkages and historical antecedents. The tradition of pan-Slavism, linking Russia to the Balkans cultural and political networks, has been uneven and is now subject to intensive debate within Russian political circles. In 1999, public opinion surveys showed consistent support in NATO countries for the bombing of Yugoslavia but strong opposition in Russia and other Slavic states. The surveys also question many stereotypes, especially the geopolitical visions of Russian citizens. Modem geopolitics is differentiated from classical geopolitics by the insertion of public opinion into the formation of geopolitical codes and foreign policy, in both the western countries and in Russia. In such an environment, the Balkans will remain central to the strategies of the great powers but public opinion, modifying geopolitical cultures, will ameliorate confrontations.

AB Purpose of review The focus of this review is on residential settings for adults with intellectual disabilities. It examines (1) the impact of type and size of settings on organizational features and resident outcomes; (2) the impact of organizational features on resident outcomes; and (3) the interaction of personal and environmental characteristics that promote a higher quality of life for residents with intellectual disabilities.
   Recent findings The research reviewed shows that in comparison with institutional settings, community-based residential services generally result in better outcomes for residents when considering adaptive behavior, self-determination, community participation, and social networks. Community services, however, do not necessarily offer quality services as the residences vary widely in their standards. Key features associated with positive outcomes for residents include homelike architectural features, use of assistive technology, organizational policies promoting individualization and person-centered planning, and staff characteristics. Some features, such as high staff-resident ratio, can result in both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the outcome studied and the competence level of the resident. Several studies have sought to explain the predictors of staff behaviors, stress, and knowledge, which are key features affecting residents.
   Summary The studies examined highlight the importance of helping staff to cope with stresses relating to their jobs, including dealing with challenging behavior, and increasing motivation, job satisfaction, and high performance through administrative support and training.

AB In the 25th anniversary issue of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Paul Krugman [Krugman, P, 1995. Growing world trade: Causes and consequences. Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (1), 327-377] stated that the answer to the fundamental question "Why has world trade grown?" remains surprisingly disputed. He noted that journalistic discussion tends to view the growth of world trade as due to technology-led declines in transportation costs, while economists argue that policy-led multilateral and bilateral trade liberalization has spurred this growth. A third potential explanation raised by Elhanan Helpman [Helpman, E., 1987. Imperfect competition and international trade: Evidence from fourteen industrial countries. Journal of the Japanese and International Economies 1 (1) 62-81] and Hummels and Levinsohn (1995) [Hummels, D., Levinsohn, J., 1995. Monopolistic competition and international trade: Reconsidering the evidence. Quarterly Journal of Economics 110 (3) 799-836] is increased similarity of countries' incomes, The purpose of this study is to disentangle from one another (and from income growth) the relative effects of transport-cost reductions, tariff Liberalization, and income convergence on the growth of world trade among several OECD countries between the late 1950s and the late 1980s. In the context of the model, the empirical results suggest that income growth explains about 67%, tariff-rate reductions about 25%, transport-cost declines about 8%, and income convergence virtually none of the average world trade growth of our post World War II sample.

TI The economic burden of malaria
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA English
DT Article
AB Malaria and poverty are intimately connected. Controlling for factors such as tropical location, colonial history, and geographical isolation, countries with intensive malaria had income levels in 1995 of only 33% that of countries without malaria, whether or not the countries were in Africa. The high levels of malaria in poor countries are not mainly a consequence of poverty. Malaria is geographically specific. The ecological conditions that support the more efficient malaria mosquito vectors primarily determine the distribution and intensity of the disease. Intensive efforts to eliminate malaria in the most severely affected tropical countries have been largely ineffective. Countries that have eliminated malaria in the past half century have all been either subtropical or islands. These countries' economic growth in the 5 years after eliminating malaria has usually been substantially higher than growth in the neighboring countries. Cross-country regressions for the 1965-1990 period confirm the relationship between malaria and economic growth. Taking into account initial poverty, economic policy, tropical location, and life expectancy, among other factors, countries with intensive malaria grew 1.3% less per person per year, and a 10% reduction in malaria was associated with 0.3% higher growth. Controlling for many other tropical diseases does not change the correlation of malaria with economic growth, and these diseases are not themselves significantly negatively correlated with economic growth. A second independent measure of malaria has a slightly higher correlation with economic growth in the 1980-1996 period. We speculate about the mechanisms that could cause malaria to have such a large impact on the economy, such as foreign investment and economic networks within the country.

AB Steady-state trophic flow models of four benthic communities (seagrass, sand-gravel, sand and mud habitats) were constructed for a subtidal area in Tongoy Bay (Chile). Information of biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the commercial and non-commercial populations was used and the ECOPATH II software of Christensen and Pauly [Ecol. Modell. 61 (1992a) 169] was applied. The sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus and the crabs Cancer polyodon, C. porteri and Paraxanthus barbiger were found to be the most prominent predators in the benthic system. The scallop Argopecten purpuratus as well as other bivalves represented the principal secondary producers in the seagrass, sand-gravel and sand habitats, while the Infauna dominated the mud habitat. The highest total biomass and system throughput (33579.3 t/km(2)/year) was calculated for the sand-gravel habitat. The sand habitat had a negative net system production due to the amount of primary production imported from deeper waters to satisfy the food requirements of the large beach clam (Mulinia sp.) populations. The mean trophic level of the fishery varied between 2.06 (sand-gravel) and 3.92 (sand) reflecting the fact that the fishery concentrates on primary producers (i.e. algae and filter feeding), and on top predators (i.e. snails and crabs). Fishery is strongest in sand-gravel habitat, where annual catches amount to 122.05 g/m(2). Low values of the relative Ascendency (A/C) (from 27.4 to 32.7%) suggest that the systems analysed are immature and highly resistant to external perturbations. Manipulations of the input data for the exploited species suggest that seagrass and sand-gravel habitats have a potential for a similar to 3 times higher than the present production of scallops and the red algae Chondrocanthus chamissoi. Preliminary results of Mixed Trophic Impacts (MTI) analysis suggest that any management policy aimed at a man-made increase in the standing stocks of A.

AB Tropical agricultural systems characterized by swidden-fallow practices have been studied in many tropical areas of the world. One feature of these systems is the high diversity of cultivated species and varieties. The objective of this paper was to analyze the inter and intraspecific diversity of cultivated crops under swidden cultivation systems adopted by caicaras in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and the genetic erosion of this diversity in the last decades. To analyze the inter and intraspecific diversity of cultivated crops under swidden cultivation systems in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, interviews were performed in 33 swidden agriculturists' households concerning the species and varieties under cultivation and others that have been lost. The plots were visited to check the crops cited in the interviews. The agriculturists cited 261 varieties from 53 crop species, with 30.6% of lost varieties. Each agriculturist cited an average of 25 varieties. The main crop was cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), followed by yams (Dioscorea spp.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Poir.), squash (Cucurbita pepo L.), sugarcane' (Saccharum officinarum L.), and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Among the interviewed agriculturists, 87% of them have sons and/or daughters not involved in agricultural activity, reflecting a trend toward the loss of the local agricultural skills. A model was proposed to explain the dynamics of the system focusing on the crop diversity and considering the resource resilience. The exchange of crop varieties among agriculturists builds a network which buffers against the loss of the managed diversity in the regional scale. Features such as the itinerancy cycles of fallow/swidden, and the traditional ecological knowledge contribute to the increasing of the managed diversity. However, the agriculturists also pointed out several factors contributing to the depletion of the managed diversity, related to restrictive environmental laws, rural exodus, increasing tourism, and changing of livelihood activities. The loss of crop diversity indicates the urgency for strategies towards the maintenance of the diversity and knowledge tied to the agricultural systems of caicara communities, calling for specific strategies and policies to avoid the loss of their agricultural legacy.

   industry towards a new model of technological innovation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT

DE technology commercialization; fuel cells; environmentally sound
   technologies
AB Economic importance of environmental issues is increasing, and new technologies are expected to reduce pollution derived both from productive processes and products, with costs that are still unknown. Until now there is still little knowledge concerning the process of technological innovation in this field. What does exist, is outdated due to rapid change in technology. In this paper we analyse the development of Zinc Air Fuel Cells (ZAFC) and their transfer from research laboratories to large mass production. ZAFC are a new 'environmental technology', proved to have a commercial value, that can be used for building Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). Although ZAFC performances are higher than traditional lead-acid batteries ones, difficulties in funding ZAFC engineering and 'moving' them from laboratories to production caused some years delay in their diffusion. On the bases of this 'paradigmatic' case, we argue that existing economic and organizational literature concerning technological innovation is not able to fully explain steps followed in developing environmental technologies. Existing models mainly consider adoption problems as due to market uncertainty, weak appropriability regime, lack of a dominant design, and difficulties in reconfiguring organizational routines. Additionally, the following aspects play a fundamental role in developing environmental technologies, pointing out how technological trajectories depend both on exogenous market conditions and endogenous firm competencies:
   1 regulations concerning introduction of ZEV 'create' market demand and business development for new technologies; they impose constraints that can be met only by segmenting transportation market at each stage of technology developmnent;
   2 each stage of technology development requires alternative forms of division and coordination of innovative labour; upstream and downstream industries are involved in new forms of inter-firm relationships, causing a reconfiguration of product architecture and reducing effects of path dependency;
   3 product differentiation increases firm capabilities to plan at the same time technology introduction and customer selection, while meeting requirements concerning 'network externalities';
   4 it is necessary to find and/or create alternative funding sources for each research, development and design stage of the new technologies. From this discussion we will draw some conclusions and issues for further researches concerning government policy and firms' strategies for sustaining the process of technological innovation and transfer.

TI Reforms in the French power system: from weak contestability to
   effective competition?
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB One way to introduce competition in the power industries is to preserve the integration of the incumbent companies and to organise the access of potential competitors to the network on a fair basis. But the combination of hierarchy and bilateral contracts between entrants (IPP candidates, foreign producers, intermediaries), suppliers and consumers appears to be unstable because of permanent tensions between the incumbent's dominant position and fair competition. Moreover; in an institutional environment enlarged by the supranational powers of the European Union, heterogeneity of rules and structures between quasi-integrated power industries and decentralised competitive ones are sources of permanent questioning. The paper analyses the stability of the recent reform of the French power industry, the extreme integration of which being deeply rooted in the French institutional peculiarities, has been weakly affected by the Directive 96/92 transcription. Two institutional scenarios are defined, which give a different weight to two competition paradigms in conflicts: one pertains to the industrial policy (which inclines to preserve hierarchy in the national area to gain national champion's competitive advantages in the European as in the global field), and the other to the neo-classical paradigm of effective competition. In the first scenario, the integration of the industrial organisation is preserved but with transparent grid access rules supposed to create an actual market contestability, and the playing field is the continental Europe on which national champions compete. In the second one, the French industrial organisation has to conform to the competitive model, with vertical and horizontal disintegration and creation of a power exchange market for promoting competition. But this scenario is heavily strained by the institutional determinism of the nuclear legacy. The future reality should be set between these two scenarios. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The production of an economic good derived from a renewable natural resource base involves the extraction of ecosystem function values as represented by the contribution made to production by the originating ecosystem. The artisanal mixed-species fisheries of Jamaica is used as a case study in the development of a biophysically based index to account for captured ecosystem values (or embodied ecosystem values) and an examination of the extent to which those values are proportionately reflected in monetary exchange values. The Index of Captured Ecosystem Value (ICEV) is developed from a basis in information theory relevant to an analysis of network flows in ecosystems. Technical coefficients, describing the production relationship between ICEV values and market values of catches associated with individual fishing efforts in Jamaican fisheries, reveal that captured ecosystem function associated with fisheries using distinct technologies (i.e. China net, trap, hand line, palanca and speargun) are valued differently by the market. This surplus value is rooted in the observation that certain fisheries target species that are more connected within the coral reef food web than those species typically captured by other fisheries. Consideration of the biophysically based contributions of coral reef ecosystems to fisheries production reveals distortions between market and supply-side values, indicating that the role of ecosystems is not being consistently treated. Comment and direction is offered regarding the development of indices of ecosystem function or value that can be applied to policy questions concerning the extraction of a renewable natural resource.

AB Aim and Location We assessed the effects of biophysical and anthropogenic predictors on deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia. This region has the world's highest absolute rates of forest destruction and fragmentation.
   Methods Using a GIS, spatial data coverages were developed for deforestation and for three types of potential predictors: (1) human-demographic factors (rural-population density, urban-population size); (2) factors that affect physical accessibility to forests (linear distances to the nearest paved highway, unpaved road and navigable river), and (3) factors that may affect land-use suitability for human occupation and agriculture (annual rainfall, dry-season severity, soil fertility, soil waterlogging, soil depth). To reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation among variables, the basin was subdivided into >1900 quadrats of 50 x 50 km, and a random subset of 120 quadrats was selected that was stratified on deforestation intensity. A robust ordination analysis (non-metric multidimensional scaling) was then used to identify key orthogonal gradients among the ten original predictor variables.
   Results The ordination revealed two major environmental gradients in the study area. Axis 1 discriminated among areas with relatively dense human populations and highways, and areas with sparse populations and no highways; whereas axis 2 described a gradient between wet sites having low dry-season severity, many navigable rivers and few roads, and those with opposite values. A multiple regression analysis revealed that both factors were highly significant predictors, collectively explaining nearly 60% of the total variation in deforestation intensity (F (2,117) = 85.46, P < 0.0001). Simple correlations of the original variables were highly concordant with the multiple regression model and suggested that highway density and rural-population size were the most important correlates of deforestation.
   Main conclusins These trends suggest that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is being largely determined by three proximate factors: human population density, highways and dry-season severity, all of which increase deforestation. At least at the spatial scale of this analysis, soil fertility and waterlogging had little influence on deforestation activity, and soil depth was only marginally significant. Our findings suggest that current policy initiatives designed to increase immigration and dramatically expand highway and infrastructure networks in the Brazilian Amazon are likely to have important impacts on deforestation activity. Deforestation will be greatest in relatively seasonal, south-easterly areas of the basin, which are most accessible to major population centres and where large-scale cattle ranching and slash-and-burn farming are most easily implemented.

AB This paper seeks to enhance understanding of the internationalization of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The study focuses upon the following issues: Can the characteristics of principal founders, businesses, and the external environment at one point in time be used to 'explain' at a later date whether a firm is still an exporter or a nonexporter, whether exporting firms are larger in size than nonexporting firms, whether, exporting firms report superior performance than nonexporting firms, and whether exporting firms are more likely to survive than nonexporting firms? To address these questions, this study draws upon a sample of 621 manufacturing, construction, and services businesses located in twelve contrasting environments in Great Britain surveyed first in 1990/91 and then re-interviewed in 1997.
   A resource-based view is reviewed to identify the range of factors encouraging some owner-managed SMEs to enter export markets. Four categories of human and financial capital are examined: general human capital resources, the principal founder's management know-how, the principal founder's specific industry know-how, and a principal founder's ability to obtain financial resources that cart act as a buffer against random shocks. Variables relating to resource availability in the external environment were also collected and considered control variables. Previous studies have highlighted substantial industry differences in the propensity for businesses to enter export markets as well as to survive. The principal industrial activity of each business in 1990/91 was, therefore, considered a control variable.
   Variables collected during the 1990/91 survey were selected to explain variations in the propensity to export reported by surviving independent firms in 1997. After elimination of missing values, the working sample was reduced to 116 independent firms for this study (86 nonexporters and 30 exporters in 1997). In addition, the 21 variables were selected to explain variations in business size in 1997 profit performance relative to competitors reported in 1997, changes in employment over the 1990/91 to 1997 period and business survival over the 1990/91 to 1997 period (213 survivors and 395 nonsurvivors).
   Multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that previous experience of selling goods or services abroad is a key influence encouraging firms to export. Businesses with older principal founders, with more resources, denser information and contact networks, and considerable management know-how are significantly more likely to be exporters. Further, businesses with principal founders that had considerable industry-specific knowledge are markedly more likely to be exporters. Businesses principally engaged in the service sectors and those located in urban areas are significantly less likely to be exporters.
   A key finding of this study is that the explanatory variables significantly associated with the propensity to export sales abroad are not the same as those significantly associated with selected size and performance measures. The resource-based explanatory variables selected Sail to significantly detect employment-growing firms over the 1990/92 to 1997 period. They also Sail to significantly distinguish surviving independent firms from nonsurviving firms.
   Results from this study will provide policy-makers and practitioners with additional insights into the key resource-based factors associated with the decision by new and small independent firms to export sales abroad. Practitioners and policy-makers can focus ripen the characteristics of principal founders, businesses and the external environment to predict the subsequent propensity of an independent firm to be an exporter. Policy-makers and practitioners who want more new and small firms to export outside their local areas may prefer to target their local areas may prefer to target their resources and assistance to the relatively smaller proportion of firms that have the business and principal founder profiles that are significantly associated with a firm being an exporter.

AB In order to assess the potential impact of climate change on terrestrial equilibrium net primary production (NPP), information about the sensitivity of terrestrial NPP to climate change is needed. A novel approach to the definition of climate sensitivity is introduced; it does not depend on specific (and uncertain) scenarios, but rather describes the worst-case climate sensitivity of NPP, as measured by the magnitude of the gradient of NPP, as a function of the climate variables. The metric in climate space necessary for the determination of the gradient is calculated using the existing spatial variation of the climate variables as a measure of the potential for climate change, taking into account the unchanging determinants of the climate-latitude and altitude. The current correlations between the climate variables are preserved using principal component analysis. The resulting map of global NPP sensitivity shows especially high values, e.g. in the US Midwest, southern Africa, Australia, western Kazakhstan, the Maghreb and Spain, The sensitivity is aggregated to the country level, excluding the effects of the very insensitive deserts, in order to make these results applicable for policy analysis. The reduced-form model 'NNN' predicts annual terrestrial NPP of potential natural vegetation in equilibrium on the basis of a climatology including monthly values for temperature, precipitation and light. The very short computing time of this model is a prerequisite for the above-described multidimensional sensitivity study. To construct NNN, the average of the global NPP results of 7 advanced climatology-driven functional vegetation models was used to obtain a 'best guess' NPP field at a 0.5degrees x 0.5degrees spatial resolution. With the underlying climatology (36 values for monthly mean temperature, precipitation and light intensity per grid element), 62 483 points of an R-36 --> R-1 mapping are defined, A subset of these was used to train a neural network yielding a good reproduction of the spatial pattern with a mean absolute error of 0.026 kg C m(-2) yr(-1), which is significantly less than the mean uncertainty of the NPP average (mean absolute deviation: 0.097 kg C m(-2) yr(-1)). Furthermore, it is shown that the simple model calculates moisture-limited regions correctly, indicating that functional properties of the original models are reproduced, We hope with the NNN to make a contribution to other research which needs a very fast reduced-form NPP model. The NNN model is accessible in FORTRAN or as a C-subprogram available at: http://www.pik-potsdam.de/-ohver/NPP.html.

AB Plants are one of the sessile components of the forest canopy, and consequently quantitative studies of plant components are more widely available than for some of their mobile counterparts. From a global perspective, several exciting and innovative canopy access tools have been designed over the past few decades that have facilitated the expansion our understanding of canopy plants. These include a network of canopy cranes, the development of the French luge (or sled), and the construction of walkways and platforms for access into different levels of the canopy on a permanent basis. At the recent international forest canopy conference in Sarasota, Florida (Forest Canopies 1998: Global Perspectives, November 4-8, 1998), many canopy plant studies were presented that illustrated the achievements in this field. As co-chair at this event, I present here some reflections based on my observations of the development of canopy research between the first and second international conferences. A selection of case studies from the conference presentations are cited in this review, including: tree crown respiration studies from the crane in Panama; epiphyte ecology from walkways in Peru; insect-plant relationships in tree crowns of the USA using platforms; experimental studies of epiphytes in cloud forests using single rope techniques; and epiphyte diversity surveys in Africa. Ideas for the future are also mentioned such as the novel concept of canopy farming of orchids in Costa Rica, the linking of canopy processes to forest floor activities, and the construction of canopy walkways to provide a sustainable forest economy instead of the conventional practice of logging. The integration of research with sustainable use of forests provides a conservation theme for future canopy studies. Such new approaches to studies of canopy plants are important, as scientists increasingly play a role in global conservation policies.

AB Women's Cardiovascular Health Network members representing 10 Prevention Research Centers completed a literature review of approximately 65 population-based studies focused on improving women's cardiovascular health through behavior change for tobacco use, physical inactivity, or diet. A framework was developed for conducting the search. Databases (Medline, Psychlit, Smoking and Health, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) of studies published from 1980 to 1998 were searched. The review was presented at a meeting of experts held in Atlanta, Georgia. Output from the meeting included identification of what has worked to improve cardiovascular health in women and recommendations for future behavioral research. Additional information is available at www.hsc.wvu.edul womens-cvh. Cardiovascular health interventions geared toward women are scant. Based on the available studies, program components that emerged as effective included personalized advice on diet and physical activity behaviors and tobacco cessation, multiple staff contacts with skill building, daily self-monitoring, and combinations of strategies. Recommendations for community-based tobacco, physical activity, and diet interventions are discussed. A few overarching recommendations were to (1) conduct qualitative research to determine the kinds of interventions women want, (2) examine relapse prevention, motivation, and maintenance of behavior change, (3) tailor programs to the stage of the life cycle, a woman's readiness to change, and subgroups, that is, minority, low socioeconomic, and obese women, and (4) evaluate policy and environmental interventions. The effects of cardiovascular interventions in women have been inappropriately understudied in women. Our review found that few studies on cardiovascular risk factor modification have actually targeted women. Hence, adoption and maintenance of behavior change in women are elusive. Intervention research to improve women's cardiovascular health is sorely needed.

TI Impact of Slovakia accession to the European Union on agrofood industry
   and food prices
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA Slovak
DT Article
AB The paper is presenting preliminary outcomes of two particular segments of policy analysis work, which has been performed since a couple of years in the RIAFE (Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics) on the assessment of sectoral. impacts of the oncoming EU accession of Slovakia: One is the price impact of accession related to farm-gate prices of the main agricultural commodities and to the food consumer prices, the second one refers to the possibly changes in the farm sector's income after the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The authors have used a modelling approach. The modelling procedure is described in chapter 1 of the body.
   For the current deviations in terms of prices and farm incomes between Slovakia and the EU-15 the existing policy gap between both entities is partly responsible (when neglecting the divergence in the overall economic performance). The level of producer support is in Slovakia approximately three times lower than in EU-15 - when related to production - and about five times lower, when related to agricultural area.
   The Slovak support system relies predominantly on budgetary transfers. The share of market price support (MPS) has been very low during all years of transition. In 2001, MPS was less than zero. In the EU-15 the dominant support is the market pride support, which is paid by consumers and as such less visible to the public. In 2001, fiscal transfers to agriculture and food amounted to 12.3 bill. SKK (USD 261 million) and made up for 4.9 per cent of state budget expenditure. The same year, in terms of OECD methodology, the support of the farm sector was in its entirety born by budget allocations.
   The relatively high market price support in the. EU contributes to the current price gap, which would disappear after Slovakia joining the Union.
   During the recent period, prices of the Central Market Organization (CMO) crop commodities have been outstripping those in the Slovakia by approximately by 40 per cent. A similar difference may be observed in case of livestock products, with strong product-by-product deviations; e. g. the price gap has been not tine for pork, but it was very significant for beef.
   For crops the average price increment as an effect of accession may be expressed by index 119 and for livestock products by index 125.
   Price differences on producer level are than reflected on the consumer level. According to our data (Table 7) consumer prices of some selected comparable food items have been in Germany by 50 to 100 per cent above the prices in Slovakia.
   The sudden change of the price level after the adoption of CAP in Slovakia is one among the public concern related to accession.
   As our price projection is showing (Table 9) only very few food items may be expected to avoid price increments. The price increase would be very different commodity-by-commodity. Consumer demand elasticities would become an important factor of this process. The capacity of consumers to accept price adjustments is than responsible for the fact, that in our projection, even after accession Slovak food prices still remain under the price level of Germany, which has been used for comparison.
   The overall nominal food price index in 2005 (first year after accession date) would account for 123 over the last year before accession (2003). Nevertheless, the share of population's expenditure on food we do not expect to soar dramatically, due to the growth of other low income elasticity costs, c. g. those for housing. We also expect, that the growth in prices mill be compensated by an income. rise within few years.
   The sectoral income effect of EU accession has already been broadly assessed by various international studies [5; 191]. As the European Commission [10] projected, in 2007 the income gain of Slovak agriculture would represent a 50 per cent increment of gross value added above the baseline in case of implementation of CAP without direct payments. This increase would be about 150 per cent above the baseline in the case of the full CAP with direct payments implementation after accession. in our view, all previous projections overestimate the income effects of the output price change, not taking into account changes, which would obviously occur on the side of production costs.
   We have examined the sectoral income effects of implementation of CAP by means of a simplified Economic Account of Agricultural (EAA) model. The simulation of implementation of the EC proposal (reduced direct payments) showed an income increase against the year 2000, but an income contraction against the most recent pre-accession year. In this model, only a re-duced scale of EAAGF - Guarantee payments has been calculated (direct payments and LFA payments) and the national supplementary payments. All other EAAGF allocations from both sections (e. g. environmental payments etc.) were omitted.
   This projection (Table 12) allows concluding that the, implementation of CAP with reduced direct payments, if the intermediate consumption and fixed capital consumption maintain the projected level, does not necessarily lead to a higher sectoral income. The income value attained under the CAP with reduced direct payments scenario is an outcome of the simulation, in which the intermediate and fixed capital consumption volumes have been derived from their current actual values at corresponding output levels further to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data taken from one representative EU-15 country (Germany).
   The second reason for reduced income values under the CAP scenario is the change in production subsidies. This is because in the model, for the period before accession, all production subsidies provided by national policies have been calculated (irrespective of whether they comply with the definition of CAP direct payments, or not). But the CAP scenario comprises only strictly this type of payments. Consequently, even with national complementary payments, in the model the sector enjoys less product-oriented subsidies after accession.
   This points to the importance of rural development and structural policy tools for the further economic sustainability of the sector after accession. This may be truth not only for Slovakia, but also for other candidate countries.

ID CITIES
AB The 'healthy city' concept has only recently been adopted in developing countries. From 1995 to 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, supported healthy city projects (HCPs) in Cox's Bazar (Bangladesh), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Fayoum (Egypt), Managua (Nicaragua) and Quetta (Pakistan). The authors evaluated four of these projects, representing the first major evaluation of HCPs in developing countries Methods used were stakeholder analysis, workshops, document analysis and interviews with 102 managers/implementers and 103 intended beneficiaries. Municipal health plan development tone of the main components of the healthy city strategy) in these cities was limited which is a similar finding to evaluations of HCPs in Europe. The main activities selected by the projects were awareness raising and environmental improvements, particularly solid waste disposal. Two of the cities effectively used the 'settings' approach of the healthy city concept, whereby places such as markets and schools are targeted. The evaluation found that stakeholder involvement varied in relation to: (i) the level of knowledge of the project; (ii) the project office location; (iii) the project management structure; and (iv) type of activities (ranging from low stakeholder involvement in capital-intensive infrastructure projects, to high in some settings-type activities). There was evidence to suggest that understanding of environment-health link was increased across stakeholders. There was limited political commitment to the healthy city projects, perhaps due to the fact that most of the municipalities had not requested the projects. Consequently the projects had little influence on written/expressed municipal policies. Some of the projects mobilized considerable resources, and most projects achieved effective intersectoral collaboration. WHO support enabled the project coordinators to network at national and international levels, and the capacity of these individuals (although not necessarily their institutions) was increased by the project The average annual running cost of the projects was approximately US$132 000 per city, which is close to the costs of the only other HCP for which a cost analysis has been undertaken Bangkok (US$115000 per year) Recommendations for these and other HCPs are provided.

TI Poverty of Romanies in connection with the labour force market in the
   Slovak republic
SO SOCIOLOGIA
LA Slovak
DT Article
AB The essay about "The poverty and the labour force market" is a part of a wider economic and sector analysis of poverty and qualitative research into Romany settlements, co-ordinated by World Bank in Slovakia (the survey carded out from December 2000 to March 2001). The analysis is focused on the essence and extent of poverty in connection with the labour force market and existing policies and programmes trying to regulate poverty of Romany population. Since the self-assertion in tabour force market is a crucial factor influencing the poverty rate, the essay puts emphasis exactly on employment and work.
   Even though there are no official statistical data about the status of Romanies in Slovakia after the year 1998 available, it is doubtless the ethnicity is in a high correlation with poverty. Our knowledge so far is confirming the fact of apparently higher poverty rate of Romany households compared to the non-Romany households. Likewise, there are other well-known specific features of poverty-stricken part of Romany population: low education standard, poor health, unacceptable living conditions, lack of access to basic infrastructure (running water, sewerage, electricity), as well as insufficient participation in executive power and interest representation.
   The aim of the qualitative analysis of Romany settlements is to fill gaps in all available data and to create a realistic picture of living conditions and social protection of Romanies in Slovakia, and their access to social service.
   The results of the qualitative analysis indicate it is not possible to approach Romany problem and Romany question as a unified issue. There is a wide inner differentiation among Romanies and this differentiation is not based on differentiation criteria applied to a majority society. Basic differentiation among Romany population is conditioned by following factors: Factor 1: state of region, factor 2: type of integration or possibly segregation, factor 3: concentration rate, total number, factor 4: majority society: Romany society ratio
   In proportion to marginalisation degree of given regions of Slovakia, also poverty degree of certain population group, especially the Romany group, is increasing. In such regions, there are settlements, i.e. segregated communities where subjectively perceived absolute poverty can be found -defined by following criteria: non-existence of a decent housing, non-sufficient number of beds for household members, shortage of money for everyday food and clothing, non-existence of working social welfare network.
   Social differentiation of Romanies is transferred into different life strategies, into taking or possibly non-taking chances and possibilities, and is displayed in all dimensions of social exclusion: economic, social, cultural, and political ones. The essay identifies main controversial issues of every above mentioned dimensions followed by possible solution proposals and measures to be taken on the systemic, as well as local and community levels. Problems and possible proposed solutions to the problems are specified institutionally, for individual social actors (state administration, local self-government, schools, churches, and non-governmental organisations).

AB The United Nations framework convention on climate change (FCCC) commits signatory nations to monitor changes in all fluxes and sinks of carbon, including those related to vegetation and soil. This paper describes a system for monitoring carbon in New Zealand's forests and shrublands (6.3 and 2.6 million ha. respectively), which was tested on a 60 km-wide transect across the South Island. A 9 km(2) grid was superimposed onto a land-cover map (SPOT imagery) to obtain 62 ground-sampling points. New permanent plots were established at 43 of these points and 18 existing plots were revisited (one site was inaccessible). On each plot, the dimensions of all trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris (CWD) were measured, and these measurements converted to per-hectare C-stocks using regression relationships. C-stocks in fine litter and mineral soil were quantified using data from New Zealand's national soil-C monitoring system that quantifies national-scale soil-C stocks using a soil-C database stratified by soil type. climate, and land-cover; we used these data to derive values for the transect.
   The total C-stock in all pools was 290 t/ha in forests and 163 t/ha in shrublands, 58 and 30% of which was living biomass (respectively). The living biomass components had the greatest variances, so precision could be improved by increasing the sample size of trees, particularly large trees. The C-stock of CWD was highly variable among plots, but was a relatively small component of the total C-stock (10% forest and 3% shrubland). For the moment, we know little about the uncertainty associated with measuring C-sequestration (i.e. change in C-stocks over time), but this information will become available when plots are resampled.
   Our network of permanent plots is designed deliberately to be simple and measurements of interest to conservation biologists, such as species composition and structure are included in the hope of protecting it against inevitable shifts in policy and focus. We discuss methodological issues including generalized allometric relationship, the propagation of errors, and better integration of remote-sensing and ground-based approaches, all of which have been considered in the development of this system.

DT Article
ID ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE
AB In this article we maintain that the cultural evolution processes of small firms are strongly influenced by the type of relationships that they establish with the economic environment.
   In the first part of the article, the main points of the discussion are set forth. Here, the theoretical debate is presented and the existing relations between the entrepreneurial culture and the interaction of firms with their economic environment is analyzed. In the second part of the article, the methodologies adopted for the statistical analysis are explained, and the results of the empirical analysis are presented. Finally, in the third part the implications for practitioners, industrial policies, and future directions in research are discussed.
   The importance of openness to change in the entrepreneurial culture is a basic assumption in this study. It is well known that in small and medium firms, entrepreneurs often demonstrate "a resistance to change'' that limits the firm's competitiveness. In some observed territorial and industrial contexts this resistance to change is determined by a cultural entrepreneurial homogeneity. This homogeneity is a result of the similarity of the social, educational and entrepreneurial experiences of the subjects observed. Indeed, the entrepreneurs studied had for generations received the same education, lived in the same area, cmd come from the same social setting. This entrepreneurial culture is typified by distrust of innovation and discontinuity, which leads these entrepreneurs to favor already proven solutions and initiate the behaviors of others, rather than take innovative actions. Principal component analysis has been used to identify the influences that various factors, within and external to the firm, have in the forming of an entrepreneurial culture and thus on the openness of entrepreneurs and firms to learning. In the sample, a trade-off emerged between tendencies to homologous behaviors and the spirit of initiative. Through cluster analysis we identified categories of entrepreneurs with a different propensity to innovation regarding established firm routines. "Learning entrepreneurs" belong mainly to industries that serve the final consumer while "bounded entrepreneurs" tend to specialize in commodities more often for export.
   The implications of our results might interest new entrepreneurs who can include this element when analyzing the viability of new ventures. Small, already operational firms, can evaluate opportunities arising from export processes or might adjust their position on the production filiere To be closer to the final market.
   This empirical analysis should be reapplied to firms in areas with different environmental characteristics or to production filieres where the relationship between customer and supplier is different, as for example in high-tech-industries, so as to verify whether the intensity of the relations with the market differs according to external factors or the technological intensity of the industries examined.

AB Essentially, this paper aims at considering how the ocean regionalisation may be implemented focusing on the principle of sustainable development, on the subsequent criteria designed by the inter-governmental organisation framework, and on the approaches from the scientific literature. In this respect, a model is proposed, according to which two main stages are identified: (i) the stage of the modern approach to the ocean, which was operated by the modern society and was supported by the culture of modernity; (ii) the stage of the postmodern approach, which has been triggered by the converging inputs from the changes in society and nature. The watershed between these two stages may be located in the 1970s. The investigation may be carried out considering a triangular relationship between (i) the changing ocean reality (ontological dimension), (ii) the representation of this reality (semiological dimension), and (iii) the building up of signified, consisting in theories, meta-theories and values (epistemological and ethical dimensions). In this framework, special relevance is attributed to the interaction between science and policy.
   Moving from this basis, how ocean regionalisation had been conceived by oceanography, geography and law is considered focusing on the implications that have arisen in terms of ocean management. Analysis is essentially focused on three questions: (i) how much the conceptual implications of the approach to the ocean regional scale have been underestimated, and how ample the political consequences have been; (ii) why the political designs referring to this spatial scale of the ocean, which have been carrying out since the 1970s, have been marked by a lack of consistency of the legal framework with the prospect of operating sustainable management programmes; (iii) whether, and what kind of, discrepancy has solidified between the legal framework, provided by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the ecosystem-oriented approach to the ocean, designed by the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).
   These considerations lead to identify three cardinal needs. First, the need to try lessons from the Regional Seas Programme of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by carrying out a critical analysis of the conceptual background and methodological endowment which it was based on, and of the subsequent political outcomes. Secondly, an increasing need for scientific approaches supported by the consideration of the ocean as a bi-modular system consisting in ecosystems and organisational patterns, being both modules subject to the impacts from global change and globalisation. Thirdly, a need to design and operate a more effective interaction between science and policy, and, as far as science in itself is concerned, the need to design a more epistemologically-sound interaction between natural and social disciplines.
   Moving from this discussion, it is proposed to distinguish the mere ocean area, where the organisational patterns have not yet created a real ocean system, from the ocean region, which differently has acquired the features of an ocean system. These two kinds of spaces may be found in the coastal milieu, extending up to the outer edge of the continental margin, in the deep-ocean, extending seawards from the continental margin, or they may extend across the continental margin and the deep-ocean. Where it is agreed that ocean reality may evolve on the basis of these two reference patterns, the following sequence of conceptual mises-au-point and statements may be considered.
   (.) The ocean area-This kind of ocean space may solidify in those areas where the ocean is frequented and used in the traditional ways without benefiting from a well-designed organisational pattern. Human presence and resource uses have brought about spatial differentiation but not such a real cohesion which may be only achieved by adopting an organisational plan.
   (.) The ocean region-This occurs only where an ocean area is endowed with such an organisational framework that allows the pursuit of clearly pre-determined objectives in terms of environmental, resource management, and economic development. This is the product of an extensive human interaction with the ocean ecosystem, and of a substantial political approach to the ocean milieu.
   Where it is agreed that ocean reality may evolve on the basis of these two reference patterns, the following sequence of conceptual mises-au-point and statements may be considered:
   (.) The ocean region and regional strategy-At the present time, ocean regions may be found only in quite limited parts of the ocean world.
   (.) The final objective-Where the decision-making centres conform their programmes and actions to the principles and guidelines from UNCED, the objective of each ocean region should be the pursuit of sustainable development on the regional scale.
   (.) Sustainable region-This occurs where the regional organisation is primarily based on the protection of the ecosystem integrity, where economic development operates through the optimisation of resource usage, and where social equity, including the access to the natural and cultural heritage of the ocean environment, is guaranteed.
   (.) Ocean regionalisation-When an individual ocean is subject to the organisational forces that lead to the creation of regions, it can be stated that an ocean regionalisation has occurred.
   (.) Global change-Ocean regionalisation should be viewed as one of the most important consequences of the global, environmental and social change that characterises the present phase of society.
   (.) Globalisation-The setting up of a transport and communication global network, together with the associated establishment of global production and consume patterns, of market strategies and social behaviour, may be regarded as the cardinal set of socio-economic factors, which ocean regionalisation is going to increasingly depend on.
   (.) Enlargement of the geographical approach-The development of ocean regions encourages to set up effective inter-disciplinary approaches, that primarily should focus on: (i) the consistency of the regional organisation with the regional objectives; (ii) the consistency of the ocean resource use with the protection of the ecosystem, primarily the safeguard of its biodiversity, productivity and resilience; and (iii) the configuration and functions of the decision-making system in guiding regional organisation.
   (.) Ocean region and ecosystem-The most desirable conditions in terms of optimal ocean organisation on the regional scale occur where the spatial extent of the ocean, which is encompassed by an individual regional management programme, fully coincides with the spatial extent of an ocean ecosystem, or with a set of contiguous ecosystems.
   (.) Decision-making systems-The more the co-operative process between decision-making systems operating in contiguous ocean regions develops, the greater the potential for a holistic political approach to the oceans becomes. The spatial consequences deriving from the interaction between the decision-making centres are of peculiar interest. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB The paper is primarily focused on analysis of selected business factors and their position in the process of globalisation and their impact on the development of world economy. In a relevant context, the effects on international business are analysed, and taking the example of the South Korean economy, the authors points out the danger of underestimating the impact of globalisation of world markets in the process of adaptation of the Korean economy.
   This part of the article responds to the analysing of the influence of process of globalisation oil the international business, as a whole. There's stressed its role by changing of organisation there, production and selling of the products on international markets, whiling of new more effective inputs a various services from all regions of the world economy and creating of the new forms of business conglomerates-multinationals, joint ventures, international business networks, etc.
   The attack of these global influences on the traditional production and international business structures is increasing the level of interdependency on traditional business units.
   The authors concentrate on the analysis of the influence of two fundamental pillars of the globalisation process-the liberalisation of international business and growth of international interdependency, emphasizing there is a certain interlinking and coherence between these pillars. Considering economic development in USA, EU and Japan lead they to explain the influence of liberalisation's tendencies on the economic growth. Its following the acceleration of international business operations and presently the expansion of globalisation on all (most) parts of world economy. Other issues analysed are impacts of globalisation on international regionalism and on the level of openness of national economies.
   The liberalisation of the international Trade can open a new opportunities in the new markets, first of all for countries in transition and less developed ones.
   The globalisation in the sphere of international business is influenced by many other sub-factors, too. Its concerned:
   a) firstly the new role of technologies in the global economic growth
   b) secondly, global diversification in the wide since. It means in the area of production, trade and investment (foreign direct investment), etc.
   Past decades, and especially the late 90s have brought several significant changes that we are facing nowadays. These changes induce new challenges, higher level of risks but also new opportunities to succeed. Its consequences, literally said, influence our every day's life in various manners.
   First there was a digital revolution, going back to 50s when the first semiconductor was produced. In that time nobody could even imagine the commercial potential of semiconductors. Later on, with a wider spread of computers, mostly thanks to government investment. Since 70s we could see accelerating growth of investment to informational technologies. Last decade of 20(th) century became a real entry point for digital economy into commerciality. But globalisation's changes in second half of tine century have not influenced only ITT (Information and Telecommunication Technology) sector. Or. the contrary, growth drive so typical for ITT has brought new "tools" also for other business sector, among which the most influenced had been commercial services and we could say that every business was somehow more or less influenced by the recent development in ITT. New forms of doing business worldwide emerged-strategic alliances, mergers acquisitions (M&A) and networks instead of hierarchy just to mention a few of them. Behind all above-mentioned changes and challenges we could a massive "wave" of globalisation, the process of creation of one world economy with one (relatively homogenous) global market and global competition as well: New challenges, new threats.
   As the authors stressed the global economy is all about constant business change. Only those able to adapt to the turbulent environment (not just in economic sense of word) are to succeed and survive. These are new winners. Others, not able to keep the step are going to lose. This is a simple rule of globalisation in the world economy. The source of adaptation is the innovation coming from constant exploration and exploitation of human's knowledge.
   The second part of the article is dedicated to the negative consequences of globalisation concerning less developed countries, increasing power of transnational corporations and existence of international institutions involved in resolving problems of national economies arising from globalisation. The authors of this paper are concentrated to most important aspects of the negative influences, as
   a) international economic environment and the chance for economic growth of LCD's
   b) influence of MNC's on the building of new positions in the world market
   c) role and competency of the state and international institutions by the eliminating of economic defects on the world markets, etc.
   It is clear that early stages of globalisation have brought benefits mostly to developed countries, due to its well-developed infrastructure as well awareness of coining challenges and opportunities. Nowadays we can witness that also less developed countries are getting drive in participation of global business. Also the problem of national and global governance emerges. There is a need to redefine the role of state/government so that the national economies could keep their competitiveness, especially facing the increasing power of MNCs. Moreover there is a problem of MNCs concerning the global rules for their worldwide activities, because they are supposed to misuse its positions and power which is mostly seen in LDCs. That is why stating the uniform rules would help avoiding these problems and encourage LDCs in increasing their involvement in global world.
