AB Background: Breast and cervical cancer screening rates remain low among immigrant women and those of low socioeconomic status. The Cancer Awareness: Ready for Education and Screening (CARES) project ran a peer-led multi-lingual educational program between 2012 and 2014 to reach under and never-screened women in Central Toronto, where breast and cervical cancer screening rates remain low. The objective of this qualitative study was to better understand how Chinese and South Asian immigrants - the largest and most under-screened immigrant groups according to national and provincial statistics - conceive of breast and cervical cancer screening. We explored their experiences with screening to date. We explicitly inquired about their perceptions of the health care system, their screening experiences with family physicians and strategies that would support screening in their communities.
   Methods: We conducted 22 individual interviews and two focus groups in Bengali and Mandarin with participants who had attended CARES educational sessions. Transcripts were coded through an iterative constant comparative and interpretative approach.
   Results: Themes fell into five major, overlapping domains: risk perception and concepts of preventative health and screening; health system engagement and the embedded experience with screening; fear of cancer and procedural pain; self-efficacy, obligation, and willingness to be screened; newcomer barriers and competing priorities. These domains all overlap, and contribute to screening behaviours. Immigrant women experienced a number of barriers to screening related to 'navigating newness', including transportation, language barriers, arrangements for time off work and childcare. Fear of screening and fear of cancer took many forms; painful or traumatic encounters with screening were described. Female gender of the provider was paramount for both groups. Newly screened South Asian women were reassured by their first encounter with screening. Some Chinese women preferred the anonymous screening options available in China. Women generally endorsed a willingness to be screened, and even offered to organize women in their community hubs to access screening.
   Conclusions: The experience of South Asian and Chinese immigrant women suggests that under and never-screened newcomers may be effectively integrated into screening programs through existing primary care networks, cultural-group specific outreach, and expanding access to convenient community -based screening.

AB Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented.

AB With rapid economic development in China, crops have undergone remarkable changes in both their type and spatial pattern. Timely and accurate information of crop type distribution will help government and agricultural producers quickly understand regional agricultural production conditions to better facilitate appropriate adjustments in planting patterns and policies. Another benefit of acquiring such knowledge of crops is that it should enhance regional agricultural competitiveness, optimize resource allocations, and further guarantee national food security. Towards this end, and using the Zhangye City in the Heihe River Basin as a study area, the present research elaborated upon a methodology to classify crop type distribution based on multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) images. Using this methodology we achieved the spatial distributions of crop types in Zhangye City in 2007 and 2012, and analyzed changes in their distributions over this period. In addition, some landscape indices were calculated to clarify the landscape pattern of crops. The crop conversion potentials in 2017 were modeled using four conversion sub-models of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Generally, the overall accuracy of crop classification in Zhangye was high, at 89.38%. From 2007 to 2012, the cultivated land area in Zhangye increased from 463.81 x 10(3) ha to 493.89 x 10(3) ha. The sowing area of corn and oilseed rape increased by 39.21 x 10(3) ha and 5.99 x 10(3) ha, respectively, while for wheat and barley the sowing area decreased by 3.61 x 10(3) ha and 9.14 x 10(3) ha, respectively. Considering other crop types as a group, their sowing area decreased by only 2.37 x 10(3) ha. The increase in corn sowing area mainly came from the conversion of other crops to corn, which accounted for 43.09% of its total sowing area in 2012. Furthermore, corn and oilseed rape showed a tendency of intensive sowing, whereas for wheat and barley the tendency was towards scattered sowing. For the future, corn has high conversion potential in Linze and Gaotai counties of Zhangye, while wheat, barley and oilseed rape have high conversion potentials in Minle and Shandan counties.

AB Background: To evaluate patients with fever of unknown origin or those with suspected bacteremia, the precision of blood culture tests is critical. An inappropriate step in the test process or error in a parameter could lead to a false-positive result, which could then affect the direction of treatment in critical conditions. Mobile health apps can be used to resolve problems with blood culture tests, and such apps can hence ensure that point-of-care guidelines are followed and processes are monitored for blood culture tests.
   Objective: In this pilot project, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of using a mobile blood culture app to manage blood culture test quality. We implemented the app at a university hospital in South Korea to assess the potential for its utilization in a clinical environment by reviewing the usage data among a small group of users and by assessing their feedback and the data related to blood culture sampling.
   Methods: We used an iOS-based blood culture app that uses an embedded camera to scan the patient identification and sample number bar codes. A total of 4 medical interns working at 2 medical intensive care units (MICUs) participated in this project, which spanned 3 weeks. App usage and blood culture sampling parameters (including sampler, sampling site, sampling time, and sample volume) were analyzed. The compliance of sampling parameter entry was also measured. In addition, the participants' opinions regarding patient safety, timeliness, efficiency, and usability were recorded.
   Results: In total, 356/644 (55.3%) of all blood culture samples obtained at the MICUs were examined using the app, including 254/356 (71.3%) with blood collection volumes of 5-7 mL and 256/356 (71.9%) with blood collection from the peripheral veins. The sampling volume differed among the participants. Sampling parameters were completely entered in 354/356 cases (99.4%). All the participants agreed that the app ensured good patient safety, disagreed on its timeliness, and did not believe that it was efficient. Although the bar code scanning speed was acceptable, the Wi-Fi environment required improvement. Moreover, the participants requested feedback regarding their sampling quality.
   Conclusions: Although this app could be used in the clinical setting, improvements in the app functions, environment network, and internal policy of blood culture testing are needed to ensure hospital-wide use.

AB The aim of this paper is to model the impacts of competition between cities on both the optimal welfare generating tolls and upon longer-term decisions such as business and residential location choices. The research uses a dynamic land use transport interaction model of two neighbouring cities and analyses the impacts by setting up a game between the two cities to maximise the welfare of their own residents. The work builds on our earlier research which studied competition in a small network using a static equilibrium approach for private car traffic without accounting for the land use responses to the change in accessibility. This paper extends the earlier work by setting up a dynamic model which includes active modes of travel and the more usual car and public transport in a realistic twin city setting and assesses the longer term relocation responses. This paper firstly sets out the competition between two hypothetical identical cities i.e. the symmetric case; and then sets out the real world asymmetric case in which the cities are of different size representative of Leeds and Bradford in the UK but equally applicable elsewhere too. We found that the level of interaction between the two cities is a key determinant to the optimal tolls and welfare gains. Our findings show that the competition between cities could lead to a Nash Trap at which both cities are worse off in terms of welfare gains. On the other hand, we found that cities, if regulated, would gain in terms of welfare and yet charge only half the toll compared with tolls under competition. We then show that the effect of competition increases with increased interaction between cities. In terms of residential location, cities with higher charges benefit from an increase in residents, though as with other studies, the relative change in population in response to cordon charging is small. The policy implications are threefold-(i) while there is an incentive to cooperate at local authority level, this is not achieved due to competition; (ii) where cities compete they may fall into a Nash Trap where both cities will be worse off compared to the regulated solution; and (iii) regulation is recommended when there is a strong interaction between the cities but that the benefits of regulation decrease as interaction between cities decreases and the impact of competition is lessened.

TI Cathinones use in Paris
SO ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
LA French
DT Review
DE Drugs of synthesis; Addiction; Sexuality; Pharmacopsychose
ID PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES; DRUG; MEPHEDRONE; ABUSE
AB Background. - The pattern of recreational drug use has changed over the last decade and now includes a multitude of substances sold as "research chemicals" or new psychoactive substances, "NPS". In France, synthetic cathinones emerged in 2008 (while first mentioned by the French police force in 2007 first alerts among users appeared in 2008) and have grown to be popular drugs of abuse. Under the Official Journal dated 11th June 2010, only mephedrone has been listed as narcotics but "designer drugs" have synthesized new substitute cathinones in order to avoid anti-drug laws. However, since July 2012, in France, all synthetic drugs from the cathinones family have been banned and listed as narcotics following the example of United Kingdom. Despite their recent classification and inclusion on narcotic list, they are readily available on Internet and used widely. Paris Addictovigilance Centre observed a signal of derivate cathinones abuse (21 cases over a two-year period).
   Objective. - Paris Addictovigilance Centre and Marmottan Hospital wanted to describe the use of cathinones in the Paris area and alert the health care community about the abuse identification and risk assessment problems of these compounds. After a review of derivated cathinone's chemical structure, pharmacology and toxicology, this article seeks to provide patricians with a clinical description and treatment's modality.
   Results. - Most users of synthetic cathinones will experience euphoria, increased energy, talkativeness, openness and increased sexual arousal. Signs and symptoms of toxicity are consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome. The main reasons for care access are psychiatric (hallucinations, psychotic symptoms, agitation) and addiction disorders. Somatic complications were described with various patterns of symptoms such as headache, tachycardia, confusional states, rhabdomyolysis with renal failure or serotonin syndrome. The most important fact is the apparition of the "slam" phenomenon among men who have sex with men (MSM). The "slam" is a compound of three characteristic elements: injection, sexual party and psychostimulant drug. According to users, "slam" is convenient for group sex and is used it to put them into a good mood and a disinhibition state. These compounds cause fast dependence syndrome with strong craving and prolonged psychiatric symptoms and increase infectious risk (HIV, VHC, VHB...). The cathinones family is not detected in conventional urine drug screenings. We point out the lack of confirmatory analytic testing data which remains the only way to determine the actual etiology of the clinical effects observed since drug users do not always know exactly what they took. These substances can be identified by special analyses using gas chromatography or liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy technology.
   Conclusion. - This injection drug is used in order to increase sexual desire, delay orgasm and decrease sexual inhibition and is prevalent in many studies on MSM samples. Cathinones would popularize the "slam". Harm reduction policy requires specific MSM interventions on both sexual and drug addiction networks. (C) 2015 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present multiple case studies of women in leadership roles in India with a view to identifying inhibitors, facilitators and the strategies adopted by them to mitigate the challenges in their odyssey to these positions. The paper contributes to the pivotal subject of under-representation of women in apex positions, which has garnered the attention of researchers in recent years grappling with the identification of the underlying causes. Thus, with a view to narrowing the gender gap in leadership positions, a greater understanding of this phenomenon is called for.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts exploratory case study method using multiple case studies. Empirical data were gathered using in-depth semi-structured interviews and personality test (NEO FFI) from women in leadership positions. The qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Findings - The analysis of data has led to the identification of challenges faced by the women that were categorised as personal, professional, organisational and social issues. Further, six themes emerged as the strategies adopted by the women leaders to overcome the challenges. The paper also highlights the critical social, behavioural and organisational facilitators that played an important role in their leadership journey. The paper also includes context-specific findings of women leaders from Indian industry.
   Practical implications - The paper would have relevance for researchers and practitioners in the field of gender diversity, leadership, organisational behaviour and human resource management. The findings of this paper can be leveraged by organisations to retain and manage female talent, which is a focal area in the present dynamic business environment, when a need for gender diversity is widely acknowledged by the top management in organisations. The exploratory case studies provide vistas for gender-based context-specific and cross-cultural research on the challenges faced by women executives in their leadership journey and the strategies adopted to mitigate these.
   Originality/value - Though a great deal has been written about the barriers to women's career advancement, less is known about the facilitators of women's advancement. Also, women in the Asian context face unique challenges which present a major problem for multinational companies whose hopes for growth are pinned on emerging markets. The paper has identified new emergent themes, which have not been mentioned in the extant literature nationally or globally. The findings provide inputs to companies to adopt policies and practices to facilitate gender equality in leadership. The paper bridges the knowledge gap and makes conceptual contributions for future research.

AB Becoming alone in old age can be a decisive life event that brings major changes depending on various causes as health status, financial resources, family situation, and available welfare services. This article discusses the situation of older people in Sweden who have transitioned from a two-person to single-person household in recent years and what impact this might have on their everyday lives. Through in-depth interviews with 18 older people, age 67-90, their experiences about life conditions and opportunities were examined. Findings showed large differences between the men and women. They all tried to live as they always had done and they used the same personal life strategies that they always had. But the men could live as before on their own financial merits, while the women needed assistance from children, grandchildren and the welfare system. Transportation options were central and clearly related to both private economy and social services available. Shortcomings in the welfare state's way of caring for the elderly were clearly uncovered. The gap between social policy promises of opportunities for autonomy and independence to live an active life in old age and the everyday reality for older people still seems to be wide. Att bli ensam pa aldre dar kan vara en avgorande handelse som ger stora forandringar i livet beroende pa orsaker som halsotillstand, ekonomiska resurser, familjesituation och tillgangliga valfardstjanster. I denna artikel diskuteras situationen for aldre personer i Sverige som har flyttat fran ett tva-personers till ensamhushall under de senaste aren och vilken betydelse det kan fa for deras vardag. Genom djupintervjuer med 18 aldre personer i aldern 67-90 ar, belyses deras erfarenheter, livsvillkor och mojligheter till ett liv som tidigare. Resultaten visade stora skillnader mellan man och kvinnor. Alla forsokte leva som de alltid hade gjort och de anvande samma personliga livsstrategier som de alltid hade haft. Men mannen kunde leva som forut pa egna finansiella meriter, medan kvinnorna behovde hjalp fran barn, barnbarn och valfardssystemet. Tillgangen till allmanna kommunikationer var en central fraga tydligt relaterad till bade den privata ekonomin och tillganglig social service. Bristerna i valfardsstatens satt att ta hand om de aldre blev tydliga. Gapet mellan socialpolitiska mal och loften om mojligheter till sjalvstandighet och oberoende for att leva ett aktivt liv i alderdomen, och den vardagliga verkligheten for aldre manniskor verkar fortfarande vara stort.

AB Objectives: Globally, disease surveillance systems are playing a significant role in outbreak detection and response management of Infectious Diseases (IDs). However, in developing countries like Pakistan, epidemic outbreaks are difficult to detect due to scarcity of public health data and absence of automated surveillance systems. Our research is intended to formulate an integrated service-oriented visual analytics architecture for ID surveillance, identify key constituents and set up a baseline for easy reproducibility of such systems in the future.
   Study design: This research focuses on development of ID-Viewer, which is a visual analytics decision support system for ID surveillance. It is a blend of intelligent approaches to make use of real-time streaming data from Emergency Departments (EDs) for early outbreak detection, health care resource allocation and epidemic response management.
   Methods: We have developed a robust service-oriented visual analytics architecture for ID surveillance, which provides automated mechanisms for ID data acquisition, outbreak detection and epidemic response management. Classification of chief-complaints is accomplished using dynamic classification module, which employs neural networks and fuzzy-logic to categorize syndromes. Standard routines by Center for Disease Control (CDC), i.e. c1-c3 (c1-mild, c2-medium and c3-ultra), and spatial scan statistics are employed for detection of temporal and spatio-temporal disease outbreaks respectively. Prediction of imminent disease threats is accomplished using support vector regression for early warnings and response planning. Geographical visual analytics displays are developed that allow interactive visualization of syndromic clusters, monitoring disease spread patterns, and identification of spatio-temporal risk zones.
   Results: We analysed performance of surveillance framework using ID data for year 2011-2015. Dynamic syndromic classifier is able to classify chief-complaints to appropriate syndromes with high classification accuracy. Outbreak detection methods are able to detect the ID outbreaks in start of epidemic time zones. Prediction model is able to forecast dengue trend for 20 weeks ahead with nominal normalized root mean square error of 0.29. Interactive geo-spatiotemporal displays, i.e. heat-maps, and choropleth are shown in respective sections.
   Conclusion: The proposed framework will set a standard and provide necessary details for future implementation of such a system for resource-constrained regions. It will improve early outbreak detection attributable to natural and man-made biological threats, monitor spatio-temporal epidemic trends and provide assurance that an outbreak has, or has not occurred. Advanced analytics features will be beneficial in timely organization/formulation of health management policies, disease control activities and efficient health care resource allocation.

AB Climate and socio-economic change will affect the land use and the economic viability of Dutch dairy farms. Explorations of future scenarios, which include different drivers and impacts, are needed to perform ex-ante policy assessment. This study uses a bio-economic farm model to assess impacts of climate and socio-economic change on dairy farms in a sandy area in the Netherlands. Farm data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network provided information on the current production levels and available farm resources. First, the farm plans of individual farms were optimized in the current situation to benchmark farms and assess the current scope for improvement. Secondly, simulations for two scenarios were included: a Global Economy with 2 degrees C global temperature rise (GE/W+) and a Regional Community with 1 degrees C global temperature rise (RC/G). The impacts of climate change, extreme events, juridical change (including abolishment of milk quota), technological change and price changes were evaluated in separate model runs within the predefined scenarios. We found that farms can increase profit both by intensification and land expansion; the latter especially for medium sized farms (less than 70 cows). Climate change including the effect of increased occurrence of extreme events may negatively affect farm gross margin in the GE/W+ scenario. Lower gross margins are compensated for by the effects of technology and price changes. In contrast with the GE/W+ scenario, climate change has positive impacts on farm profit in RC/G, but less favourable farm input-output price ratios have a negative effect. Technological change is needed to compensate for revenue losses due to higher input prices. In both GE/W+ and RC/G scenarios, dairy farms increase production and the use of artificial fertilizer. Medium sized farms have more options to increase profit than the large farms: they benefit more from the abolishment of the milk quota and better adapt to negative and positive impacts of climate change.
   While the exact impact of different drivers will always remain uncertain, this study showed that changes in prices, technology and markets have a relatively larger impact than climate change, even when extreme events are taken into account. By using whole farm plans as activities that can be selected, the model is grounded in observations, and it was shown that half of the farms are gross margin maximizers as assumed in the model. The model therefore indicates 'what could happen if', and gives insights in drivers and impacts of dairy farming in the region. (C) 2015 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is that on the basis of the competitive edge theory, source mechanism and evaluation approaches of industrial cluster competitiveness, combined with international trends in the automobile industry and the features of Chinese automobile industrial cluster development, an evaluation index system about cluster competitiveness of auto industry is built with comprehensive consideration of factors such as cluster development environment, external scale effect and internal competitiveness from the perspective of value chain of automobile industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - An evaluation index system for automobile industrial cluster competitiveness was realized by integrating current strengths and future growth capacities with multidimensional, dynamic and comprehensive characteristics, which included 3 second-level, 10 third-level and 16 fourth-level indices. In the light of evaluation methods, a group intelligence optimization algorithm (cuckoo search)-and traditional methods of complex decision-making system-analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-were combined to propose the cuckoo-AHP evaluation method. It was applied for the calculation and optimization of weight values in an automobile industrial cluster competitiveness evaluation index for the purpose of obtaining better scientific and more reliable results.
   Findings - The research might further enrich the evaluation theory of automobile industrial cluster competitiveness and also can be useful for showing how traditional evaluation methods can be combined with intelligent algorithms to carry out better automobile industrial cluster competitiveness evaluations. In addition, studies of channels for kick-starting Chinese auto industrial cluster competitiveness are expected to provide references for how to enhance the cluster competitiveness of the Chinese automobile industry.
   Practical implications - Changsha and Liuzhou, the Guangxi automobile industrial clusters as the two empirical analysis objects selected for this paper, are geographically adjacent to each other. The automobile industries of the two cities are local pillar industries with the strong support of the local government. Both clusters have their own advantages and weak points with different characteristics of cluster development, and they enjoy a representative significance amongst China's numerous auto industrial clusters that are taking shape. Comparative analysis of both clusters serves as a good reference for the objective evaluation of the competitiveness of Chinese automobile clusters in terms of their real and practical developments and in respect of the success of reasonable scientific and industrial cluster policies.
   Originality/value - Multidimensional, dynamic, integrated evaluation index systems are constructed around automobile industrial cluster competitiveness, which has taken into account developments in current strengths and future growth capacity. The cuckoo-AHP evaluation method has been formed by combining the traditional decision-making method known as AHP with a new meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called "cuckoo search". Both have been used in evaluations of automobile industrial cluster competitiveness in Liuzhou and Changsha, which will be beneficial for enriching automobile industrial cluster competitiveness evaluation theory and new evaluation methods that will enable better evaluations of automobile industrial cluster competitiveness.

AB Objectives. - This paper intended to offer a broad literature review on global Jihad terrorism. In the wake of recent terrorist attacks that stroke Paris twice in 2015, and the numerous defused plots this year, the authors sought to determine if there is a way to get a better understanding of the radicalization process. How individuals could become radicalized to the point of engaging into violent actions and suicide missions and is there any underlying psychopathology? The authors focused on two types of terrorists: lone wolves and those acting as part of a group. We will explain that psychopathology could not be linked with the "group" type. We will discuss some aspects of the psychological mechanisms involved into the group dynamics that bond individuals towards this (self-) destructive goal, but also how law enforcement officers should be prepared to counter-interrogation techniques spread amongst members of organized cells. Finally, we will see how a deradicalization process might take place.
   Methods. - The authors relied on a broad literature review in order to address the issues mentioned above. Mainly for two reasons, the first one being that most of suicide mission leaves no author to interview or to assess; second, access to highly sensitive cases of terrorism is not possible unless being involved within the judicial process such as psychological or psychiatric assessments of survivors or members of a dismantled cell, but data then could not be used for publication, these are the reasons why the authors used open source data and international articles and books dealing with the topic of global Jihad.
   Results. As noticed by Hoffman, the term terrorism comes from the French "(Regime de) Terreur" and implies a political goal, the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "A policy intended to strike with terror those against whom it is adopted; employment of methods of intimidation; the fact of terrorizing or condition of being terrorized". From the mid-1990s during which France was already hit by terrorism, through the 9/11 to the recent attacks of November, the aspect of the "global Jihad" evolved and the attacks that took place in Paris and also worldwide in 2015, claimed by Daech bring some points to be taken into consideration when dealing with this type of terrorism. First, the will to die and to gain martyrdom, which is not considered as a suicide, is central for an understanding of this morbid process. Most of the terrorists seem to be looking for a greater-than-themselves cause that they could embrace, and the ideology offered by Daech correspond to an "epic" vision of the world. This view serves as an encompassing model in which the reality is perceived through a "us versus them" prism that possesses a paranoid tone. Second, some strategic considerations, which will not be developed here, why France has been more specifically targeted? The development of "homegrown" terrorists, as Sageman noted it in 2006 and the rise of ISIL (Daech) from 2010 and the instauration of a Caliphat as a base and training ground offered to the new recruits had created a fertile soil for jihad motivated attacks. Through this extensive literature review the authors found that, contrary to the "lone wolf' figure in which psychopathology and psychiatric symptoms could often easily be found, members of organized terrorist cells are not "insane", they are very much dedicated to a cause but are not suffering from any psychosis or bipolar disorders. Exploring the ideas developed by Sageman, Moghaddam amongst others, the authors underline the slow process for developing and sharing radical beliefs but also that taking part to violent actions could be faster than imagined by a layman and is regularly a matter of networking through friendship and kinship. Thus, group psychology is of peculiar importance to understand the mechanisms at stake. It appears that radicalization is grounded on a vacuum of existential significance and by an ascending process, through the sharing of an ideology prone to violent actions, leads individuals to engage in terrorist goals for a collective one, greater than them. The authors then focused on some interrogatory techniques developed by foreign law enforcement agencies. And finally, what could be done to reverse this radicalization process, basically reintegrating a sense of individualistic needs and addressing the radical beliefs with a religious teaching. It should be noted that this last part is at the very beginning of its experimentation in Europe and that it might not be used for every individual involved in terrorism (e.g., it could be proven efficient with people that has been radicalized, but not efficient with individual on the brink of violent terrorist actions). The central need to counter radicalization is a social one, a project of society shared by everyone, as it seems clear that the sense of alienation and exclusion from the working environment and positive social perspectives is a strong leverage, but not the only one, used by jihadist recruiters.
