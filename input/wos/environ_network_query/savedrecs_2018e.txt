AB The agricultural development on newly reclaimed lands has led to many national debates about food security and budget deficits, and the living conditions of the new settlers at the local level. This debate is still crucial for present day Egypt, a country facing major challenges, including food security, agriculture modernization, employment generation, and land fragmentation due to dramatic population growth. In this context, policy makers are always seeking the best land allocation system for these new lands. This paper analyzes the land tenure and land use dynamics of farmers' settlements during a program of land reclamation (from 1960 to 2010) in the Western Desert of the Nile Delta. The objective is to describe the land development paths of farm settlement and to identify promising dynamics by cross-referencing the farmers' stories and their livelihood achievements. To accomplish that, we conducted household surveys and interviews to learn the life stories' of 175 family farms. Our study finds that, beyond the rules and institutions that fixed the land tenure regimes and its distribution in these new lands, settlers have found different ways to hold on and secure their land farm, even if the unequal land distribution still structure the population. The results highlight also the dynamism of small-scale settlers, regarding livelihood diversification, to face the challenges of these desert environments. In addition, the dual-purpose system embedded in mixed crop-livestock systems can contribute to settlers' livelihood security. These realities confound the unchanged rhetoric of government and this calls for more social consideration of these new rural spaces based on a combination of heterogeneous networks off relationships and knowledge. The apparent gap between the macro- and micro-perspectives analyses also requires multi-scale assessments. Finally, the life-story method proves to be a complementary and useful approach to integrate the livelihood representation and dynamic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundThe social meanings, settings and habitual nature of health-related activities and their integration into our daily lives are often overlooked in quantitative public health research. This reflects an overly individualized approach to epidemiological surveillance and evaluations of public health interventions, based on models of behaviour that are rooted in social cognition and rational choice theories. This paper calls for a new approach to alcohol epidemiology and intervention research informed by theories of practice.
   ArgumentPractices are conceptualized as routinized types of human activity that are made up of, and can be recognized by, the coming together of several interwoven elements in the same situation (e.g. materials, meanings, skills, locations, timings). Different practices are interconnectedthey can occur simultaneously (e.g. drinking and eating), hold each other in place (e.g. after-work drinks) or compete for time (e.g. parenting versus socializing). Applying these principles to alcohol research means shifting attention away from individuals and their behaviours and instead making drinking practices an important unit of analysis. Studying how drinking practices emerge, persist and decay over time, how they spread through populations and local or social networks and how they relate to other activities of everyday life promises new insights into how, why, where, when and with whom drinking and getting drunk occur.
   ConclusionsTheories of practice provide a framework for generating new explanations of stability and change in alcohol consumption and other health behaviours. This framework offers potential for novel insights into the persistence of health inequalities, unanticipated consequences of policies and interventions and new interventions targets through understanding which elements of problematic practices are likely to be most modifiable. We hope this will generate novel insights into the emergence and decay of drinking practices over time and into the geographical and socio-demographic patterning of drinking. Theories of practice-informed research would consider how alcohol policies and population-level interventions might differentially affect different drinking practices.

AB Emission data is an essential tool for understanding environmental problems associated with sources and dynamics of air pollutants in urban environments, especially those emitted from vehicular sources. There is a lack of knowledge about the estimation of air pollutant emissions and particularly its spatial and temporal distribution in South America, mainly in medium-sized cities with population less than one million inhabitants. This work performed the spatial and temporal disaggregation of the on-road vehicle emission inventory (El) in the medium-sized Andean city of Manizales, Colombia, with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km and a temporal resolution of 1 h. A reported top-down methodology, based on the analysis of traffic flow levels and road network distribution, was applied. Results obtained allowed the identification of several hotspots of emission at the downtown zone and the residential and commercial area of Manizales. Downtown exhibited the highest percentage contribution of emissions normalized by its total area, with values equal to 6% and 5% of total CO and PM10 emissions per km(2) respectively. These indexes were higher than those obtained in residential-commercial area with values of 2%/km(2) for both pollutants. Temporal distribution showed strong relationship with driving patterns at rush hours, as well as an important influence of passenger cars and motorcycles in emissions of CO both at downtown and residential-commercial areas, and the impact of public transport in PM10 emissions in the residential-commercial zone. Considering that detailed information about traffic counts and road network distribution is not always available in medium-sized cities, this work compares other simplified top-down methods for spatially assessing the on-road vehicle El. Results suggested that simplified methods could underestimate the spatial allocation of downtown emissions, a zone dominated by high traffic of vehicles. The comparison between simplified methods based on total traffic counts and road density distribution suggested that the use of total traffic counts in a simplified form could enhance higher uncertainties in the spatial disaggregation of emissions. Results obtained could add new information that help to improve the air pollution management system in the city and contribute to local public policy decisions. Additionally, this work provides appropriate resolution emission fluxes for ongoing research in atmospheric modeling in the city, with the aim to improve the understanding of transport, transformation and impacts of pollutant emissions in urban air quality.

TI Downscaling national road transport emission to street level: A case

AB Emissions from road transport are routinely prepared at the national scale in many countries under different national and international policies, directives and legislation. Scaling down this emission to the smaller geographical area is considered as a top-down approach. Several methods have been previously applied to scaling down emission, however these have often reported inconsistent findings in comparison with emission distribution using a bottom-up approach. Carbon dioxide and particulate matter (smaller than about 2.5 mu m) emissions from a national road transport estimation in Ireland were dis-aggregated among four counties in the Greater Dublin Area and subsequently distributed at a finer spatial scale (0.5 x 0.5 km(2)). Spatial coverage of the proxy variables, spatial weight distribution and appropriate representation of the fleet characteristics were identified as main sources of difference in distributed spatial emissions between top-down and bottom-up approaches. The first two issues were addressed in this paper by predicting missing or absent traffic volume from limited datasets, and the later was addressed by considering the fleet and mileage data from national annual vehicle test data at county level. A neural network model was applied to predict traffic volume which showed a 51% precision in prediction performance. Emission distribution was also performed for comparison purposes using a more conventional road density-based approach, where a correlation analysis showed an inconsistency between the two approaches. The results of this study highlighted that if the fleet characteristics at county level were not considered, the estimated emission would be different by -1.6 to -8.6% (Carbon dioxide) and -12.6 to 0.03% (Particulate matter) for passenger cars and -3.57-13.6% (Carbon dioxide) and -0.054-16.8% (Particulate matter) for light and heavy duty vehicles, depending on the counties in question. This study revealed that a share of 22.6% and 21.1% of national carbon dioxide and particulate matter emission occurred in Dublin County alone, and Dublin city was attributed to approximately 10.5% carbon dioxide and 9.8% particulate matter of the national total. The particulate matter in Dublin County was 14.3-22.4% higher than surrounding counties, and carbon dioxide emissions in Dublin city were two times higher than that of the towns and urban areas in the surrounding three counties. This study provides a combination of methods for producing finer scale spatial estimation of emission to facilitate abatement strategies and mitigation action plans at county and municipality level for the reduction of emission, better air quality and climate. The study highlights the necessity of reliable spatial distribution methods for assigning emission at a finer scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Human settlements and transport networks are growing rapidly worldwide. Since the early 20th century their expansion has been accompanied by increasing illumination of the environment at night, a trend that is likely to continue over the decades to come. Consequently, a growing proportion of the world's ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night, profoundly altering natural cycles of light and darkness. While in recent years there have been advances in our understanding of the effects of artificial light at night on the behaviour and physiology of animals in the wild, much less is known about the impacts on wild plants and natural or semi-natural vegetation composition. This is surprising, as effects of low-intensity light at night on flowering, phenology and growth form are well known in laboratory and greenhouse studies.
   2. In a long-term experimental field study we exposed a semi-natural grassland to artificial light at intensities and wavelengths typical of those experienced by roadside vegetation under street lighting.
   3. We found that lighting affected the trajectory of vegetation change, leading to significant differences in biomass and plant cover in the dominant species.
   4. Changes in flowering phenology were variable between years, with grass species flowering between 4 days earlier and 12 days later under artificial light.
   5. Policy implications. Our results demonstrate that artificial light, at levels equivalent to those in street-lit environments, can affect species composition in semi-natural vegetation. This highlights the importance of considering artificial light as a driver of vegetation change in urban, suburban and semi-natural ecosystems, and where possible, of minimising or excluding artificial light from habitats of conservation importance.

AB Growing resource demands by humans, invasive species, natural hazards, and a changing climate have created broad-scale impacts and the need for broader-extent conservation activities that span ownerships and even political borders. Implementing regional-scale conservation brings great challenges, and learning how to overcome these challenges is essential for maintaining biodiversity (i.e., richness and evenness of biological communities) and ecosystem functions and services across scales and borders in the face of system change. We administered an online survey to examine factors potentially driving perspectives of protected-area (PA) managers regarding coordination with neighboring PAs and other stakeholders (i.e., stakeholder coordination) for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services during the next decade within diverse regions across Europe. Although >70% (n = 58) of responding PA managers indicated that climate change and invasive species are relevant for their PAs, they gave <50% probability that these threats could be mitigated through stakeholder coordination. They thought there was a >60% probability (n = 85) that stakeholder coordination would take place with the aim to improve conservation outcomes. Consistent with the foundation on which many European PAs were established, managers viewed maintaining or enhancing biodiversity as the most important (>70%; n = 61) expected benefit. Other benefits included maintaining or enhancing human resources and environmental education (range of Bayesian credibility intervals [CIs] 57-93%). They thought the main barriers to stakeholder coordination were the lack of human and economic resources (CI 59-67% chance of hindering; n = 64) followed by communication and interstakeholder differences in political structures and laws (CI 51-64% probability of hindering). European policies and strategies that address these hindering factors could be particularly effective means of enabling implementation of green infrastructure networks in which PAs are the nodes.

AB Growing interest in sustainable transportation systems has driven decision-makers toward policies and investments aimed at promoting cycling, but little to no effort has been made toward incorporating bicycle transport in transport planning models. This study contributes toward this direction by estimating a bicycle route choice model in value-of-distance space from a large sample of 3384 cycling trips that were traced with GPS devices in the Copenhagen Region. The novelty of this study lies in (i) observing cyclists' behavior in a cycling-oriented country, (ii) exploiting rich data about the cycling environment, (iii) estimating the model in value-of-distance rather than preference space, and (iv) not focusing only on preferences for traditional variables (e.g., distance, turns, hilliness, intersections, motorized road characteristics), but also on perceptions and preferences for bicycle facilities (e.g., bicycle lanes, bicycle paths, bicycle traces) and land-use designations (e.g., residential, industrial, sports, scenic areas). The findings from the model show that: (i) cyclists exhibit heterogeneous preferences for avoiding right and left turns, cycling the wrong way, using roundabouts and bridges, and cycling alongside residential and scenic areas; (ii) cyclists dislike cycling on unpaved and hilly surfaces and alongside larger roads; (iii) cyclists have clear perceptions about different types of bicycle facilities, with a preference for bicycle lanes and segregated paths; (iv) cyclists have clear perceptions about land-use designations, with a preference for cycling alongside sports and scenic areas; (v) time-of-day and air temperature contribute to the perceptions of cyclists and their preferences for bicycle facilities and land-use designations.

AB Colonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at 'foresting' the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of exotic tree species. These efforts persisted despite economic losses and ecological evidence that native tree seedlings planted in the grasslands repeatedly failed to establish. These policies continued unabated into the late twentieth century in newly independent India. Today, the once picturesque landscapes of these ancient forest-grassland mosaics are diminished by large-scale plantations of exotic species. Some of these species have become invasive and pose significant threats to the remnant natural grasslands. While this historical narrative is set in the forest-grassland mosaics of southern India, it finds striking parallels in the current day, with grasslands and savannas globally threatened by the misperception that they are 'degraded ecosystems' that can be 'forested' or converted to other 'productive' land uses. We suggest that this case history portends the potential fates of many of earth's threatened tropical grasslands and savannas.

AB In this paper, we apply an agent-based approach to explain both the final state and the dynamics of the development process of the wine sector in the Malopolska region in Poland. This sector has been affected by various environmental, institutional, behavioural and social factors and has undergone evolutionary changes in recent years. The econometric analysis of empirical data of vineyards in this region provides insights into the degree of influence of various factors under consideration on the aggregate number of vineyards in subregions. However, this does no explain the dynamics of the local formation of new vineyards or the underlying latent attitudes of vineyard owners. To overcome this limitation, we developed an agent-based model with heterogeneous agents (regular farms as well as large and small vineyards), which allowed us to identify a two-stage development scenario: i) community building and ii) vineyard creation. Our findings are of two types. Firstly, we showed a case where the agent-based model has good predictive power, in situations where the econometric model fails. Secondly, estimation of the agent-based model parameters and sensitivity analysis revealed crucial factors that have driven development of viticulture in the Malopolska region. In particular, we find that the crucial element underlying the good predictive power of the model is that it enables us to capture the fact that wine enthusiasts initially concentrate in sub-regions with more benign environmental conditions. Next, when one of them eventually established a vineyard, agents in the community had a lowered barrier to entry via the possibility of practical knowledge exchange, joint marketing efforts or vineyard maintenance resource sharing. This is in line with current evidence, which shows strong clustering effects, namely, a relatively large number of vineyards originate at relatively similar times and locations.

AB Aflatoxins are highly toxic metabolites of several Aspergillus species widely distributed throughout the environment. These toxins have adverse effects on humans and livestock at a few micrograms per kilogram (mu g/kg) concentrations. Strict regulations on the concentrations of aflatoxins allowed in food and feed exist in many nations in the developing world. Loopholes in implementing regulations result in the consumption of dangerous concentrations of aflatoxins. In Kenya, where 'farm-to-mouth' crops become severely contaminated, solutions to the aflatoxins problem are needed. Across the decades, aflatoxins have repeatedly caused loss of human and animal life. A prerequisite to developing viable solutions for managing aflatoxins is understanding the geographical distribution and severity of food and feed contamination, and the impact on lives. This review discusses the scope of the aflatoxins problem and management efforts by various players in Kenya. Economic drivers likely to influence the choice of aflatoxins management options include historical adverse health effects on humans and animals, cost of intervention for mitigation of aflatoxins, knowledge about aflatoxins and their impact, incentives for aflatoxins safe food and intended scope of use of interventions. It also highlights knowledge gaps that can direct future management efforts. These include: sparse documented information on human exposure; few robust tools to accurately measure economic impact in widely unstructured value chains; lack of long-term impact studies on benefits of aflatoxins mitigation; inadequate sampling mechanisms in smallholder farms and grain holding stores/containers; overlooking social learning networks in technology uptake and lack of in-depth studies on an array of aflatoxins control measures followed in households. The review proposes improved linkages between agriculture, nutrition and health sectors to address aflatoxins contamination better. Sustained public awareness at all levels, capacity building and aflatoxins related policies are necessary to support management initiatives.

TI Analytical Method to Determine Transportation Service Gaps for

AB Transportation disadvantaged (TD) populations, which include elderly people, people with disabilities, and people who do not own a vehicle, face mobility challenges because alternative transportation services are limited. To identify specific transportation service gaps for TD populations, an assessment of both transportation demand and transportation accessibility is necessary. Previous studies have focused on a single aspect of transportation accessibility or on studying geographic transportation gaps at the state or county level. This study develops a methodology aimed at identifying TD populations with major gaps in alternative transportation services. Using spatial overlays and network analysis, we develop a model for calculating transportation supply through a comprehensive transportation accessibility measure that considers relevant trip destinations and three alternative transportation services: public transportation, on-demand services, and taxi services. Gaps in service are identified by overlaying the TD population demand volume with transportation accessibility. The resulting supply-demand matrix highlights transportation deficient areas and populations, based on overlays of high demand and low supply. We apply this methodology to Alachua County, Florida. Results expose areas of deficiency, some in unexpected places. The findings highlight the need to assess alternative transportation for TD populations, to determine gaps to be addressed to improve TD populations' mobility and reduce personal auto trips and related traffic injuries. This method can guide policy makers in fostering equitable transportation provision across users.

AB Mountain communities are considered particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, and their vulnerability is sometimes assumed to be increasing because of a loss of food self-sufficiency. Based on a case study of Nagar District in the Karakoram of northern Pakistan, the present article challenges this assumption by taking a broader perspective on food systems and their changes in recent decades. Defining food security as the outcome of a resilient food system, it investigates how major transformations of livelihoods and farming systems since the 1970s have increased or decreased the resilience of food systems in Nagar in various ways. Based on empirical field research conducted between 2014 and 2016, the study finds that local food systems have transformed from largely subsistence-oriented systems of food production and consumption to increasingly complex, multilocal networks in which off-farm livelihoods, external markets, and government-subsidized food supplies play central roles. This process of diversification of food systems has generally improved communities' resilience to food crises, despite the emergence of various new risks. The article argues that rather than overemphasizing local food self-sufficiency, research and policy related to food security in mountains must address the multidynamic and multifaceted character of food systems, as local production constitutes only one of several interrelated elements.

AB Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth's life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depend." We recommend this as the end goal that the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less than what is required from a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require States to attend to trade-offs and overlaps. We argue that continuous failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize realization of this ultimate end goal. Therefore, we adopt a systems approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets of the SDGs as well as leverage points for effective intervention. We triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling, and keyword network analysis to draw out seven "overarching directions" that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance efficient implementation of the SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g., intergenerational equity and population); inadequate reconciliation of economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient consideration of the relationship with international law. Conceptual mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and implementation; sustainable consumption and production; and addressing the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword analysis highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what appears at face value. Keywords "access," "women," "resources,"and "finance" feature across the SDGs and provide further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate realization of a high proportion of SDGs and correspondingly could have a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude that the success of the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of "planetary must-haves" for current and future generations.

AB We examined the link between victimisation and life satisfaction for 85,301 gay and bisexual individuals across 44 European countries. We expected this negative link to be stronger when the internalised homonegativity of the victim was high (e.g. because the victim is more vulnerable) and weaker when victimisation occurs in countries that express intolerance towards homosexuality (e.g. because in such contexts victims expect victimisation more and they attribute it to their external environment). Additionally, we expected internalised homonegativity to relate negatively to life satisfaction. Multilevel analyses revealed that victimisation (i.e. verbal insults, threats of violence, minor or major physical assaults) and internalised homonegativity were negatively related to life satisfaction. Furthermore, as we expected, the negative link between victimisation and life satisfaction was stronger when high internalised homonegativity was reported (and the interaction effect occurred for verbal insults and major assaults as outcome variables), while it was weaker when there was low national tolerance of homosexuality (and the interaction effect occurred for verbal insults and for minor assaults). Future research and social policy should consider how the consequences of victimisation are dependent on personal as well as national attitudes towards homosexuality.

AB Improving social service in local communities is a complex undertaking. Over the past few decades, the performance and sustainability of community initiatives have been questioned, while such factors as a lack of funding, insufficient community involvement, unsatisfactory community service, and lack of awareness of the impact of community initiatives have restricted community development. From a case study of community operations in Scotland, this article provides insights into how social service delivery is organized in the absence of public capital. This study utilized data from semi-structured in-depth interviews with a sample of 76 participants from a deprived area in Scotland, including community management team members (n = 6), local residents (n = 52) and community partners (n = 18). The findings illustrated how participants of all ages, local organizations, policy makers, funders and media came together to create a cohesive and responsive community environment. Residents' needs and funders' demands were identified. Results further revealed that a Community Partnership Mechanism helped strengthen the social service network and create flexible social services. Service benefits included improved resident wellbeing in the context of less government intervention. Future implications include suggestions for government and other stakeholders involved in community reform to focus on service recipient skill building and tracking changes between the indicators and service provision.

AB Global warming has become a growing concern for countries around the world. Currently, the direct way to solve this issue is to curb carbon emissions. Governments and enterprises should assume the social responsibility to conserve the environment. Under the background of carbon emission constraint, this article investigates the optimal decisions of closed-loop supply chains in the context of social responsibility, explores the impacts of constraints of carbon emissions and corporate social responsibility on recycling and remanufacturing decisions, and introduces the model of maximizing social welfare for further comparison and analysis. The results show that the coefficient of remanufacturing and emission reduction and the coefficient of government reward and punishment are inversely proportional to recycling rates and the total carbon emissions. Governments should formulate rational carbon emission caps for enterprises with different coefficients of remanufacturing and emission reduction. Additionally, corporate social responsibility has a positive effect on recycling rates, and a rise in its strength can lead to a fall in carbon emissions per unit product. In terms of product recycling and profit sources, the model of maximizing social welfare is superior to that of maximizing the manufacturer's total profits, which provides new managerial insights for decision-makers.

AB Coastal regions worldwide are during the process of rapid urban expansion. However, expanded urban settlements in land-sea interfaces have been faced with unprecedented threats from climate change related hazards. Adaptation to coastal hazards has received increasing attention from city managers and planners. Adaptation and land management practices are largely informed by remote sensing and land change modeling. This paper establishes a framework that integrates land change analysis, coastal flooding, and sea level rise adaptation. Multilayer perceptron neural network, similarity learning, and binary logistic regression were applied to analyze spatiotemporal changes of residential, commercial, and other built-up areas in Bay County, Florida, USA. The prediction maps of 2030 were produced by three models under four policy scenarios that included the population relocation strategy. Validation results reveal that three models return overall acceptable accuracies but generate distinct landscape patterns. Predictions indicate that planned retreat of residents can greatly reduce urban vulnerability to sea level rise induced flooding. While managed realignment of the coast brings large benefits, the paper recommends different mixes of adaptation strategies for different parts of the globe, and advocates the application of reflective land use planning to foster a more disaster resilient coastal community.

AB The limited availability of ammonia (NH3) measurements is currently a barrier to understanding the vital role of NH3 in secondary aerosol formation during haze pollution events and prevents a full assessment of the atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen. The observational gaps motivated us to design this study to investigate the spatial distributions and seasonal variations in atmospheric NH3 on a national scale in China. On the basis of a 1-year observational campaign at 53 sites with uniform protocols, we confirm that abundant concentrations of NH3 [1 to 23.9 mu g m(-3)] were identified in typical agricultural regions, especially over the North China Plain (NCP). The spatial pattern of the NH3 surface concentration was generally similar to those of the satellite column concentrations as well as a bottom-up agriculture NH3 emission inventory. However, the observed NH3 concentrations at urban and desert sites were comparable with those from agricultural sites and 2-3 times those of mountainous/forest/grassland/waterbody sites. We also found that NH3 deposition fluxes at urban sites account for only half of the emissions in the NCP, suggesting the transport of urban NH3 emissions to downwind areas. This finding provides policy makers with insights into the potential mitigation of nonagricultural NH3 sources in developed regions.

AB In this review, we discuss the role of hedgerow structure and condition in determining the value of hedgerow habitat for biodiversity conservation within an agricultural context, to inform and evaluate hedgerow management decisions and policy. Through a systematic literature review, narrative synthesis and vote counting, key structural condition indicators were identified for a range of conservation priority taxa. Abundance, survival or fecundity of ground vegetation, birds, mammals and invertebrates were affected by height, width, woody biomass, foliar quality and quantity, and gappiness of hedgerows. Although general patterns may not occur, a response to a particular structural feature can vary both within and between taxonomic groups, many responses are synergistic and interdependent. In conclusion, the definition of a "good quality" hedgerow for biodiversity conservation should be expanded to include all those key structural features which are important across taxa. Furthermore, the importance of heterogeneity in hedgerow structural condition is highlighted, where no fixed set of hedgerow characteristics were found to benefit all taxa. If uniform hedgerow management is over prescribed, as has been the tendency with some agri-environment schemes, some species (including those of conservation concern) are likely to be adversely affected by a loss of suitable habitat or resource decline.

AB Scientific evidence should dominate in any management decision dealing with alien species. It is also essential for all stakeholders to agree on the terminology used to avoid undesirable misinterpretations. A well-known example is the use of the term invasive, which has two basic meanings, one as a biogeographic criterion and the other as an impact criterion. The aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) is a North African ungulate introduced in Spain, which was labeled invasive by Spanish authorities due to misreading of the term used by early studies. Indeed, to date, there are no conclusive empirical data showing negative effects of the aoudad on native flora and fauna. Recent studies have shown that its closest native ungulate, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), has expanded throughout territories already occupied by the aoudad, without any apparent conflict. Aoudad diet selection studies also show them to be markedly grazers, so its role in the Mediterranean trophic network might be similar to that of extinct wild ungulates that fed in natural meadows, maintaining landscapes heterogeneous. New opportunities for its study are opening, particularly in Iberian semiarid lands. Unfortunately though, its current simplistic definition as an invasive species keeps in suspense its eventual eradication throughout the country.

AB Motivated by a recent survey suggesting fast delivery among the most desired features that drive people to shop online, this study aims to investigate service competition in the context of inventory and environmental constraints. We consider a price and service time sensitive market in which two retailers sell substitutable types of products. They compete horizontally for the same group of customers, and they decide independently the service time guaranteed to the consumers. Both retailers adopt stationary base-stock policy. We find that when carbon emissions are not regulated, the choice of service time is closely related to the focus of competition. When price competition intensifies, service competition is deprioritized, and longer service time is used. When service competition is fierce, service time is reduced for greater market share. However, when carbon emissions are regulated by carbon tax, greater level of price competition leads to shorter service time while higher level of service competition results in longer service time, which is opposite to the unregulated situation. Furthermore, we conclude that simply imposing carbon tax may not bring the expected reduction in carbon emissions if consumers are insensitive to their carbon footprints and willing to absorb the carbon cost for speedy service.

AB Cluster theories have been applied in studies of various industries and regions, including tourism in rural areas, but rarely in the equestrian industry. The focus of this article is to report on the development of an emerging micro-cluster within, and related to, equestrian tourism industry in Northwest Iceland. The research was based on a document analysis and open-ended interviews. Through an account of the development of cluster-related activities and by drawing up a cluster map of both core and related equestrian activities in the Northwest, the study reflects on the impact and character of the cluster development. The conclusions reveal a progression towards a micro-cluster, intertwined with business activities and lifestyle. Education, knowledge transfer and spreading of know-how are important activities for both regular operation and innovation within the micro-cluster. Additionally, there are strong connections to tourism and agricultural clusters. The cluster development strengthens the business environment for equestrian businesses and the competitiveness of the Northwest. New markets and growth opportunities can be exploited and collaboration with supporting and related industries can be further intensified. Such a positive development leads to investment in infrastructure and innovation activities including creation of new jobs in the region, and growth in local rural development.

AB Bandwidth verification in shaping scenarios receives much attention of both operators and clients because of its impact on Quality of Service (QoS). As a result, measuring shapers' parameters, namely the Committed Information Rate (CIR), Peak Information Rate (PIR) and Maximum Burst Size (MBS), is a relevant issue when it comes to assess QoS. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, TBCheck, which serves to accurately measure such parameters with minimal intrusiveness. These measurements are the cornerstone for the validation of Service Level Agreements (SLA) with multiple shaping elements along an end-to-end path. As a further outcome of this measurement method, we define a formal taxonomy of multi-hop shaping scenarios. A thorough performance evaluation covering the latter taxonomy shows the advantages of TBCheck compared to other tools in the state of the art, yielding more accurate results even in the presence of cross-traffic. Additionally, our findings show that MBS estimation is unfeasible when the link load is high, regardless the measurement technique, because the token-bucket will always be empty. Consequently, we propose an estimation policy which maximizes the accuracy by measuring CIR during busy hours and PIR and MBS during off-peak hours. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Can distinctive natural assets in tourist destinations be artistically recreated and used to improve destination image and attract more visitors? This paper analyses the formation of the tourist image based on artistically recreated local nature icons, and shows how those images can enhance the overall destination image. It focuses on the island of Lanzarote, a destination with its development based on promoting an environmental image founded on the creation of a network of multifunctional, high-quality art, culture and tourism centres exhibiting artistic recreation of its unique environmental assets. The methodology utilizes a questionnaire (n = 453) structural equations modelling approach in which the overall image of the destination is directly dependent on the image of the environmental conditions and indirectly influenced by the image of the artistically recreated centres. Results show that the destination's image is significantly grounded on the image of the art, culture and tourism centres using art based on Lanzarote's natural assets. They suggest that destinations have relevant opportunities to artistically enhance natural assets to improve their tourist image and marketing, that quality multi-functional visitor centres can be important within a sustainable tourism policy, and part of the emerging breadth of approaches taken by sustainable tourism marketing.

AB European large stationary sources are currently emitting more than 1.4 Gt of CO2 every year. A significant decrease in greenhouse gases emissions cannot be achieved without carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. However, although being practiced for over 30 years, CO2 transportation is intrinsically characterised by the risk of leakage. This study proposes to assess and tackle this issue within the CCS design problem, by proposing a spatially explicit mixed integer linear programming approach for the economic optimisation of a European supply chain for carbon capture, transport and geological storage, where societal risk assessment is formally incorporated within the modelling framework. Post-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion and pre-combustion are considered as technological options for CO2 capture, whereas both pipelines (inshore and offshore) and ships are taken into account as transport means. Both inland-inshore and offshore injection options are available for carbon geological sequestration. Risk mitigation measures are considered in the design of the transport network. The overall supply chain is economically optimised for different minimum carbon reduction scenarios. Results demonstrate that accounting for societal risk may impact the overall carbon sequestration capacity, and that the proposed approach may represent a valuable tool to support policy makers in their strategic decisions.

AB This article investigates farm technical efficiency (TE) and the effect of heterogeneity on production among farms using the Slovenian Farm Accountancy Data Network sample of farms in the period 2007-2013. We model production technology with a random parameter model that allows us to examine both the direct effect of heterogeneity on production and the indirect effect through the interaction of unobserved heterogeneity with time and input variables. Additionally, we consider intersectoral heterogeneity among types of farming. Results confirm the importance of all these sources of heterogeneity. The second contribution of the article is that, in addition to using conventional statistical methods, we examine the differences between less favored area (LFA) and non-LFA farms using matching techniques. Results indicate that there is only a minor and statistically nonsignificant difference in TE between these groups. However, the difference is highly significant in terms of heterogeneity and technology. In other words, results show that farms in LFAs are not more inefficient but rather use different, production-environment-specific technologies. These findings call attention to the fact that omitting the effect of heterogeneity on production technology leads to biased TE estimates and, in turn, leads to potentially imperfect policy choices.

AB The effects and risks of the myriad novel substances circulating at music festivals are poorly understood by many paramedics, police, and other support staff. It is often the drug enthusiasts known as psychonauts, who experiment with new substances and document their experiences using procedures and discourses drawn from science, who possess the most extensive and up-to-date information. Concerned about harm arising from misinformation, especially regarding novel substances, many psychonauts attend festivals hoping to help reduce it. However, the chaotic yet heavily policed festival environments can complicate their efforts. This article draws on participant observation and interviews with psychonauts at transformational festivals, supported by an online qualitative survey, to examine their three harm reduction strategies: volunteering as peer support workers (sitters') at drug crisis care spaces, informal mentoring, and responsible dealing' (carefully sourcing and dispensing the drugs themselves). It also considers the impact of festival settings and their drug policy environments. Understanding of drug experiences gave psychonaut sitters and mentors advantages over other festival support workers, but tough policing practices fostered mistrust of sitters and increased the risks of responsible dealing'. Ultimately, psychonauts' scientific' approach may be more effective as a reassuring discursive strategy than a practical way of reducing harm.

   sensitivity: combining disparate lines of evidence
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English

ID UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CLOUDS
AB Where policy and science intersect, there are always issues of ambiguous and conflicting lines of evidence. Combining disparate information sources is mathematically complex; common heuristics based on simple statistical models easily lead us astray. Here, we use Bayesian Nets (BNs) to illustrate the complexity in reasoning under uncertainty. Data from joint research at Resources for the Future and NASA Langley are used to populate a BN for predicting equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The information sources consist of measuring the rate of decadal temperature rise (DTR) and measuring the rate of percentage change in cloud radiative forcing (CRF), with both the existing configuration of satellites and with a proposed enhanced measuring system. The goal of all measurements is to reduce uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity. Subtle aspects of probabilistic reasoning with concordant and discordant measurements are illustrated. Relative to the current prior distribution on ECS, we show that after 30years of observing with the current systems, the 2 sigma uncertainty band for ECS would be shrunk on average to 73% of its current value. With the enhanced systems over the same time, it would be shrunk to 32% of its current value. The actual shrinkage depends on the values actually observed. These results are based on models recommended by the Social Cost of Carbon methodology and assume a Business as Usual emissions path.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to act as an economically-disruptive transportation technology offering several benefits to the society and causing significant changes in travel behavior and network performance. However, one of the critical issues that policymakers are facing is the absence of a sound estimation of their market penetration. This study is an effort to quantify the effect of different drivers on the adoption timing of AVs. To this end, we develop an innovation diffusion model in which individuals' propensities to adopt a new technology such as AVs takes influence from a desire to innovate and a need to imitate the rest of the society. It also captures various sources of inter-personal heterogeneity. We found that conditional on our assumptions regarding the changes in market price of AVs over time, their market penetration in our study region (Chicago metropolitan area) will eventually reach 71.3%. Further, model estimation results show that a wide range of socio-demographic factors, travel pattern indicators, technology awareness, and perceptions of AVs are influential in people's AV adoption timing decision. For instance, frequent long-distance travelers are found to make the adoption decision more innovatively while those who have experienced an accident in their lifetime are found to be more influenced by word of mouth.

AB BACKGROUNDThe Oklahoma Mesonet (the statewide environmental and weather monitoring network) has monitored changes in weather patterns since 1994 to provide accurate and timely mesoscale weather information to farmers and other groups. Studies are still scarce that would quantitatively assess farmers' perceptions about the value of the Oklahoma Mesonet contributions to agricultural operations, profitability of land management, and decision making. This paper aims to analyze those questions by means of an exploratory empirical study in Oklahoma for two groups of Mesonet users and non-users.
   RESULTSFamiliarity with and application of Mesonet information determines farmers' profitability assessments and decision making. Farmers' perceptions are also influenced by the degree of previous exposure to weather-related losses. The median estimate of the economic value of Mesonet information is $1000 per year. Mesonet users perceive higher profitability from the application of Mesonet data at 7.6/10, whereas Mesonet non-users provided an average assessment of 2.6/10.
   CONCLUSIONSConsistent use of Mesonet information results in a higher assessment of the importance of Mesonet. This research provides some initial insights into farmers' perceptions about the value of Oklahoma Mesonet information, which could guide stakeholders in developing measures to better serve farmers with environmental monitoring data for improved farm decisions.

AB The rapid expansion of China's high-speed rail (HSR) networks presents an opportunity to make urban economies more consumer-oriented. Many commercial and business districts have been planned in the areas surrounding stations. This study examines and critiques the impacts of HSR on commercial land markets in Jiangsu: a pioneering province for HSR development in China. After considering various locational and contextual factors, this study focuses specifically on how HSR stations and the frequency of train services have affected the dynamics of commercial land markets, using a spatial panel approach. The results show that the opening of HSR services has significantly impacted trade volumes, while the frequency of train services has significantly affected trade prices. Further analysis shows variation in the impacts of HSR stations and train service frequency on commercial land markets between Jiangsu's developed south and less-developed central and northern sub-regions. The findings suggest that the study of HSR impacts is sensitive to the selected spatial scale. Moreover, HSR development may not result in the creation of dynamic commercial economies for every city. Consequently, locally based policies are needed to take advantage of the transport-induced opportunities.

AB 1 Farmland biodiversity has declined over the past few decades. European Common Agricultural Policy encourages farmers to set up agri-environment schemes (AES) that support biodiversity and associated ecosystem services such as pollination. Although few AES are specifically devoted to pollinating insects, many AES could provide resources for pollinators. In Belgium, AES designed to provide seed resources for wild birds (bird-strip AES) contain mixed-plant communities that may benefit insects, although their ability to support pollinators has not yet been evaluated.
   2 The present study aimed to assess the ability of bird-strip AES to support pollinating insects. We identified and quantified floral resources, flower-visiting insects and insect-flower interaction networks over 2 years on four bird strips located in intensive agro-ecosystems in Belgium.
   3 The bird strips contained plant species that were either purposely sown or established spontaneously. The spontaneous Cirsium species, with its high nectar production, offered floral resources that complemented those of the sown species Raphanus sativus and Phacelia tanacetifolia. Most of the flower-visiting insects considered as pollinators belonged to the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera.
   4 In conclusion, bird-strip AES provided floral resources to pollinators, even in the absence of annual sowing.

AB One of the strongest and most consistent predictors of self-regulated driving is gender, with women more likely than men to limit their driving in situations like bad weather or at night. However, studies have focused more on documenting these gender patterns than on explaining the processes underlying them, which may vary in their implications for transportation, health and ageing policy. Our study addresses this issue by examining two potential explanations for women's greater likelihood of self-regulated driving: their greater health limitations and use of driving alternatives. Using a nationally representative sample of older Americans (2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study, N = 4,842), we conducted logistic regressions predicting driving under four limitations: alone, at night, in rain or other bad weather and on highways. Our results provide stronger support for the driving alternatives explanation, especially women's greater reliance on rides from family and friends. Health limitations do contribute to explaining one of the self-regulated driving behaviours - avoiding driving alone. Our findings suggest that willingness to use driving alternatives is part of transitioning from driving. However, the relatively low use of all the alternatives we examined points to the importance of better understanding older adults' transportation needs and preferences, including their gendered dimensions.

AB Ongoing climate warming has been demonstrated to impact the cryosphere in the Indian Himalayas, with substantial consequences for the risk of disasters, human well-being, and terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present evidence that the warming observed in recent decades has been accompanied by increased snow avalanche frequency in the Western Indian Himalayas. Using dendrogeomorphic techniques, we reconstruct the longest time series (150 y) of the occurrence and runout distances of snow avalanches that is currently available for the Himalayas. We apply a generalized linear autoregressive moving average model to demonstrate linkages between climate warming and the observed increase in the incidence of snow avalanches. Warming air temperatures in winter and early spring have indeed favored the wetting of snow and the formation of wet snow avalanches, which are now able to reach down to subalpine slopes, where they have high potential to cause damage. These findings contradict the intuitive notion that warming results in less snow, and thus lower avalanche activity, and have major implications for the Western Himalayan region, an area where human pressure is constantly increasing. Specifically, increasing traffic on a steadily expanding road network is calling for an immediate design of risk mitigation strategies and disaster risk policies to enhance climate change adaption in the wider study region.

AB Over the past four years, the Big Data and Exascale Computing (BDEC) project organized a series of five international workshops that aimed to explore the ways in which the new forms of data-centric discovery introduced by the ongoing revolution in high-end data analysis (HDA) might be integrated with the established, simulation-centric paradigm of the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Based on those meetings, we argue that the rapid proliferation of digital data generators, the unprecedented growth in the volume and diversity of the data they generate, and the intense evolution of the methods for analyzing and using that data are radically reshaping the landscape of scientific computing. The most critical problems involve the logistics of wide-area, multistage workflows that will move back and forth across the computing continuum, between the multitude of distributed sensors, instruments and other devices at the networks edge, and the centralized resources of commercial clouds and HPC centers. We suggest that the prospects for the future integration of technological infrastructures and research ecosystems need to be considered at three different levels. First, we discuss the convergence of research applications and workflows that establish a research paradigm that combines both HPC and HDA, where ongoing progress is already motivating efforts at the other two levels. Second, we offer an account of some of the problems involved with creating a converged infrastructure for peripheral environments, that is, a shared infrastructure that can be deployed throughout the network in a scalable manner to meet the highly diverse requirements for processing, communication, and buffering/storage of massive data workflows of many different scientific domains. Third, we focus on some opportunities for software ecosystem convergence in big, logically centralized facilities that execute large-scale simulations and models and/or perform large-scale data analytics. We close by offering some conclusions and recommendations for future investment and policy review.

AB The direct and wider impacts of high-speed rail (HSR) have long been the interest of academia and policy makers. Studies on China's experience just began to accumulate but remain inadequate given the size and speed of the country's HSR and regional growth. This paper reports a benchmark analysis of HSR impacts on travel times, accessibility, economic productivity, and regional disparity in the context of China's current growth initiative centered at city-cluster regions. The study utilized data from year 2006 without HSR and 2014 with HSR for 266 prefectural level cities and analyzed HSR's impacts at the spatial scales of nationwide, territorial regions, and city-cluster regions. In the study, travel times measured the city-to-city average travel times by rail, whereas accessibility analysis applied a gravity model of total employment. Three indicators of economic productivity were calculated: Gross Regional Product (GRP) per capita, per worker, and per square kilometer of built-up land. Finally, regression models framed around economics production theory were estimated. The main findings are: HSR contributed to travel times savings, accessibility enhancement, and productivity gain but with limitations. HSR reduced city-to-city travel times at a national average by 45% or 589 min. City-clusters in Western China, where the starting level of travel times were long, enjoyed a greater rail time reduction than other regions. HSR increased accessibility of all cities and regions; a simplified decomposition analysis estimated HSR's contribution being 25-45% of total accessibility change. Access disparity within most city-cluster regions decreased, whereas the between-region gaps remained during the study period. The study estimated HSR elasticity of GRP per capita being 0.28 nationwide. Responses to HSR varied greatly among city-clusters when measured in GRP per worker and per built-up area terms. As China's HSR network continues to expand, optimizing HSR impacts should focus on integrating fully with other transportation modes and fitting well with national and local development initiatives.

AB Background: The location of General Practitioner (GP) facilities is an important aspect in the design of healthcare systems to ensure they are accessible by populations with healthcare needs. A key consideration in the facility location decision involves matching the population need for the services with the supply of healthcare resources. The literature points to several factors which may be important in the decision making process, such as deprivation, transportation, rurality, and population age.
   Methods: This study uses two approaches to examine the factors associated with GP accessibility in Northern Ireland. The first uses multinomial regression to examine the factors associated with GP coverage, measured as the proportion of people who live within 1.5 km road network distance from the nearest GP practice. The second focuses on the factors associated with the average travel distance to the nearest GP practice, again measured using network distance. The empirical research is carried out using population and geospatial data from Northern Ireland, across 890 Super Output Areas and 343 GP practices.
   Results: In 19% of Super Output Areas, all of the population live within 1.5 km of a GP practice, whilst in 24% none of the population live within 1.5 km. The regression results show that there are higher levels of population coverage in more deprived areas, smaller areas, and areas that have more elderly populations. Similarly, the average travel distance is related to deprivation, population age, and area size.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that GP practices are located in areas with higher levels of service need, but also that care needs to be taken to ensure rural populations have sufficient access to services, whether delivered through GP practices or through alternative services where GP practices are less accessible. The methodology and results should be considered by policy makers and healthcare managers when making decisions about GP facility location and service provision.

AB High demand for tea has driven the expansion of tea plantations in the tropical and subtropical regions over the past few decades. Tea plant cultivation promotes economic development and creates job opportunities, but tea plantation expansion has significant impacts on biodiversity, carbon and water cycles, and ecosystem services. Mapping the spatial distribution and extent of tea plantations in a timely fashion is crucial for land use management and policy making. In this study, we mapped tea plantation expansion in Menghai County, Yunnan Province, China. We analyzed the structure and features of major land cover types in this tropical and subtropical region using (1) the HH and HV gamma-naught imagery from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and (2) time series Landsat TM/ETM + /OLT imagery. Tea plantation maps for 2010 and 2015 were generated using the pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) approach at 30 m resolution, which had high user/producer accuracies of 83.58%/91.67% and 87.50%/90.83%, respectively. The resultant maps show that tea plantation area increased by 33.56% (similar to 9335 ha), from similar to 27,817 ha in 2010 to similar to 37,152 ha in 2015. The additional tea plantation area was mainly converted from forest (32.50%) and cropland (67.50%). The results showed that the combination of PALSAR and optical data performed better in tea plantation mapping than using optical data only. This study provides a promising new approach to identify and map tea plantations in complex tropical landscapes at high spatial resolution.

AB A well-functioning swine health system is crucial to ensure a sustainable pig production. Yet, little attention has been paid to understand it. The objective of this study was to unravel the complexity of a swine health system by using a systems-thinking approach for the case of Flanders (Northern part of Belgium). To that end, qualitative interviews were held with 33 relevant stakeholders. A hybrid thematic analysis was conducted which consisted of two phases. First, an inductive thematic analysis was conducted and second, the resulting themes were classified into the building blocks of a systemic framework. This framework combined a structural and a functional analysis that allowed to identify the key actors and their functions. Additionally, a transformational analysis was performed to evaluate how structures and the entire swine health system enable or disable functions. Findings revealed that the Flemish swine health system presents several merits such as the synchronization of policies and sector's agreements to reduce the antimicrobial use in the pig sector and the presence of a rich network of universities and research institutes that contribute to the education of health professionals. Nevertheless, several systemic failures were observed at different levels such as the lack of a good professional body representing the swine veterinarians, the tradition that veterinary advice is provided for 'free' by feed mill companies, and the shortage of reliable farm productivity data. Both latter failures may hinder swine practitioners to provide integrative advice. While few veterinarians are remunerated per hour or per visit by farmers, the most common business model used by veterinarians is largely based on the sale of medicines. Thus, veterinarians encounter often a conflict of interest when advising on preventive vaccinations and, in turn, farmers distrust their advice. On a positive note, alternatives to the traditional business model were suggested by both veterinarians and farmers which may indicate that there is intention to change; however, the broader institutional and socio-cultural environment does not enable this evolution. The results of this study can aid policy makers to anticipate the effects of proposed interventions and regulations so that they can be fine-tuned before they are enforced.

TI Access and egress times to high-speed rail stations: a spatiotemporal
   accessibility analysis

AB Accessibility by high-speed rail (HSR) depends not only on station-to-station travel time, but also on access and egress times, which can be determining factors in total journey travel time. However, studies focusing on accessibility analyses of access/egress times to/from stations are less extended in the literature and centre mainly on the influence of access times to stations on HSR accessibility levels on a regional scale. This paper's aim is to evaluate the importance of access and egress times to/from HSR stations in an urban context. We carry out a spatiotemporal accessibility analysis that considers the temporal variations of both taxi and public transport travel times. General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files for public transport and TomTom Speed Profiles data for cars are used to measure access/egress times. These kinds of data allow for the calculation of travel times from/to HSR stations through network analysis GIS tools at different times of the day, and thus a spatiotemporal accessibility measure can be obtained. This accessibility measure is complemented by a mass factors representing the activity 'hotspots' in the visited city throughout the workday, which is derived from Twitter data, while population is considered for city of residence. This method was applied to the two largest metropolitan areas in Spain: Madrid and Barcelona, where the influence of access/egress times acquires a higher relevance for rail-based trips. The results obtained show that access and egress times vary significantly during the day, depending on the levels of traffic congestion and the frequency of public transport services, which are always more favourable for taxis. In addition, weighted average access and egress times at the home end are higher than those at the activity end since population tends to show more dispersed spatial patterns than activities. Another interesting finding is that the first and last mile of the HSR trip usually account for a high percentage increase in travel time (about 35% for taxis and 55% for public transport, respectively). These results have important policy implications. The paper suggests that HSR accessibility can be improved also by improving local transport services, scheduling coordination and land use policies.

AB Based on the modem theory of regulation, the analysis aims to characterize the effective economic regulation of the French railway industry. The methodology consists in econometrically testing various scenarios of regulation and determining which of these best fits the data.
   Using aggregate data on the overall passenger traffic for the incumbent French rail operator (RO), SNCF, the two behavioral hypotheses of reference which we consider - absence of regulation of the rail operator which acts as a pure monopoly, and price regulation of services supplied by the RO - are both statistically significant and do not subtract from each other. This result is certainly related to the fact that passenger services include both high speed train services, for which the RO has some entrepreneurial freedom, and regional transport services, which are regulated by local authorities. In any case however, as the presence of unobservable efforts exerted by the RO to improve its productivity is statistically relevant, one concludes that the RO is not fully and properly regulated. This emphasizes that the design of policy reforms must account for the incentives they create on the RO.
   The analysis also shows that the most statistically significant scenarios are the ones in which the access tariff imposed by the infrastructure manager is such that the revenue generated by the access tariff is equal to the infrastructure spending. The pricing of the access to the infrastructure network therefore does not seem to be governed by economic principles, but more by budget considerations.
   While data limitations does neither allow to understand all the facets of a complex reality, nor to claim a high level of precision in the measure of all the parameters of interest, we believe however that we provide an objective methodology to characterize the optimal economic policies for the railway sector, in particular because it yields realistic estimates of the main structural parameters. Indeed the empirical results suggest that the railway industry as a whole exhibits increasing returns to scale, which incidentally is not compatible with the presence of multiple firms. In addition, the elasticity of demand for railway transport is relatively high, an indication of the competitive constraints this mode of transport faces from other transport modes or induced traffic.

AB Increased use of inorganic fertilizer in smallholder farming systems can significantly raise crop productivity, enabling farming households to improve their food security both directly, through greater food supply, and indirectly, though higher agricultural incomes, and to set themselves economically on a pathway out of poverty. Low fertilizer use by African smallholder farming households is evidence of the difficulties they face in accessing the commercial input at a price that will allow them to obtain sufficient and reliable returns from their investment. This paper presents the results of a broad study of fertilizer supply to smallholder farmers in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda to assess whether costs faced at various points along the import and marketing chain, or the absence of key public goods and services, reduce the access that smallholder farmers have to fertilizer. The study involved a mixed methods approach that included for each country a review of the literature on fertilizer supply, demand, and use; interviews with key participants in fertilizer import and marketing; and two surveys - one with farmers and one with input suppliers. We found that the governments of the three countries have used distinct approaches in developing or regulating the fertilizer sub-sector. Based on use levels, Tanzania has been the most successful in ensuring access to fertilizer for its farmers. Mozambique lags the most. Several areas were identified where government inaction or misdirected efforts are having an adverse effect on efforts to increase agricultural productivity through the increased use of inorganic fertilizer. The most important constraints to increased fertilizer uptake stem from missing public goods that are not specific to inorganic fertilizer but are implicated in broad efforts to increase rural economic growth, particularly in continuing to expand and deepen crop output markets to ensure reliable returns to the use of fertilizer and in improving rural transportation networks. In addition, the three governments can do more to foster competitive agricultural input markets. All propose more state regulation on trade in inorganic fertilizer than is warranted. Moreover, particularly in Tanzania, by not consistently acting in line with policies for agricultural commercialization in place, government increases the commercial risks faced by both input suppliers and farmers and undermines the development of vibrant agricultural markets, both for inputs and outputs, including food.

AB Drought is a complex and multivariate phenomenon influenced by diverse physical and biological processes. Such complexity precludes simplistic explanations of cause and effect, making investigations of climate change and drought a challenging task. Here, we review important recent advances in our understanding of drought dynamics, drawing from studies of paleoclimate, the historical record, and model simulations of the past and future. Paleoclimate studies of drought variability over the last two millennia have progressed considerably through the development of new reconstructions and analyses combining reconstructions with process-based models. This work has generated new evidence for tropical Pacific forcing of megadroughts in Southwest North America, provided additional constraints for interpreting climate change projections in poorly characterized regions like East Africa, and demonstrated the exceptional magnitude of many modern era droughts. Development of high resolution proxy networks has lagged in many regions (e.g., South America, Africa), however, and quantitative comparisons between the paleoclimate record, models, and observations remain challenging. Fingerprints of anthropogenic climate change consistent with long-term warming projections have been identified for droughts in California, the Pacific Northwest, Western North America, and the Mediterranean. In other regions (e.g., Southwest North America, Australia, Africa), however, the degree to which climate change has affected recent droughts is more uncertain. While climate change-forced declines in precipitation have been detected for the Mediterranean, in most regions, the climate change signal has manifested through warmer temperatures that have increased evaporative losses and reduced snowfall and snowpack levels, amplifying deficits in soil moisture and runoff despite uncertain precipitation changes. Over the next century, projections indicate that warming will increase drought risk and severity across much of the subtropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, a consequence of regional precipitation declines and widespread warming. For many regions, however, the magnitude, robustness, and even direction of climate change-forced trends in drought depends on how drought is defined, with often large differences across indicators of precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, and vegetation health. Increasing confidence in climate change projections of drought and the associated impacts will likely depend on resolving uncertainties in processes that are currently poorly constrained (e.g., land-atmosphere interactions, terrestrial vegetation) and improved consideration of the role for human policies and management in ameliorating and adapting to changes in drought risk.

AB Urban environments typically exhibit large atmospheric pollution variation, in both space and time. In contrast to traditional monitoring networks suffering from a limited spatial coverage, mobile platforms enable personalized high-resolution monitoring, providing valuable insights into personal atmospheric pollution exposure, and the identification of potential pollution hotspots. This study evaluated personal cyclist exposure to UFPs, BC and heavy metals whilst commuting near Antwerp, Belgium, by performing mobile measurements with wearable black carbon (BC) and ultrafine particle (UFP) instruments. Loaded micro-aethalometer filterstrips were chemically analysed and the inhaled pollutant dose determined from the exhibited heart rate. Considerable spatial pollutant variation was observed along the travelled routes, with distinct contributions from spatial factors (e.g. traffic intersections, urban park and market) and temporary events. On average 300% higher BC, 20% higher UFP and changing elemental concentrations are observed along the road traffic route (RT), when compared to the bicycle highway route (BH). Although the overall background pollution determines a large portion of the experienced personal exposure (in this case 53% for BC and 40% for UFP), cyclists can influence their personal atmospheric pollution exposure, by selecting less exposed commuting routes. Our results, hereby, strengthen the body of evidence in favour of further policy investments in isolated bicycle infrastructure.

AB Nowadays, process optimization has been an interest in engineering design for improving the performance and reducing cost. In practice, in addition to uncertainty or noise parameters, a comprehensive optimization model must be able to attend other circumstances which might be imposed in problems under real operational conditions such as dynamic objectives, multi-responses, various probabilistic distribution, discrete and continuous data, physical constraints to design parameters, performance cost, computational complexity and multi-process environment. The main goal of this paper is to give a general overview on topics with brief systematic review and concise discussions about the recent development on comprehensive robust design optimization methods under hybrid aforesaid circumstances. Both optimization methods of mathematical programming based on Taguchi approach and robust optimization based on scenario sets are briefly described. Metamodels hybrid robust design is discussed as an appropriate methodology to decrease computational complexity in problems under uncertainty. In this context, the authors' policy is to choose important topics for giving a systematic picture to those who wish to be more familiar with recent studies about robust design optimization hybrid metamodels, also by attending real circumstances in practice. In particular, production and project management are considered as two important methodologies that could be improved by applications of advanced robust design combining with metamodel methods.

AB Sustainable consumption and production are considered to be fundamental ways to solve problems with environmental resources that human beings are facing. There is a broad consensus that promoting sustainable consumption requires the joint efforts of different social actors. This paper aims to define the roles of different stakeholders and the relationships between them, and then establish a modeling framework to analyze those relationships between stakeholders, which include members of government, business, consumer, mass media, environmental non-government organizations, education and research institutions, financial markets, etc. The research found that members of government, business, and consumers make up the core stakeholder network. The modeling framework could be used to evaluate sustainable consumption practices and identify deficiencies that would assist in defining better trajectories. This paper describes the evaluation of sustainable consumption practice in Tianjin, China from a stakeholder perspective to show how the modeling framework can function. According to this analysis, the following six actions may promote sustainable consumption practices in areas like Tianjin: 1) the cultivation of a consciousness of sustainable consumption, 2) the exemplary role of government, 3) a series of laws, regulations, and policies, 4) a thorough sustainable consumption action plan, 5) an insistence on sustainable production and consumption by businesses and consumers, and 6) the concerted efforts of various stakeholders.

AB This study used respondent-driven sampling to explore the effects of social support on HIV risk and protective factors among young males who have sex with males (YMSM) in Bangkok (N = 273) and Chiang Mai (N = 243), Thailand. It compared different measures of social support, including living situation, the proportion of family and friends to whom the respondent had disclosed their same-sex attraction, and scores on the multi-dimensional scale of perceived social support as predictors of two outcomes of interest-coerced first sex and HIV knowledge. Social support from family played a mediating role in both outcomes among YMSM in Bangkok but not those from Chiang Mai. Though social support from friends was also studied, it was less strongly associated with the outcomes of interest. The findings support interventions designed to leverage social support networks to increase HIV knowledge and decrease coerced first sex among YMSM. At the same time, they demonstrate that there is not a single risk or demographic profile encompassing all YMSM. Successful programs and policies will need to consider the specific attributes and social environment of YMSM in particular locations in order to effectively address HIV risks.

AB The aim of this paper is to examine the mobility characteristics of the elderly in rural settlements with different accessibility (low accessibility, medium accessibility, and high accessibility), defined in relation to the facilities that are important to the elderly and the transport network density. Another aim is to define and analyze the transport potential of the rural elderly population. The paper is based on research carried out in 2012 and 2013 in rural areas of Serbia. The data were collected through a household survey specially designed for rural areas, from a sample of 346 elderly respondents. Based on the data analysis, it was found that mobility of the rural elderly population in Serbia is generally low, but there are significant differences among rural settlements with different accessibility, with age and possession of a driving license having a major impact on mobility. It was also found that the transport alternative choice set of the majority of respondents consists of four modes of transport, which is due to the fact that the rural elderly live in multi-member households. However, considering the identified demographic trends in Serbian rural areas, the transport potential of the elderly is likely to be lower in the future, and this should inform future rural transport policy with the aim of mitigating transport deprivation and social exclusion.

AB Currently, many consumers have expressed strong opinions about food production process, its distribution, and guaranteeing models. Consumers' concerns about ecological and social sustainability issues can have significant impacts on both food demand and food policies. The choice of approach to an asset or service could determine the orientation of the markets; therefore, it is particularly important to pay attention to novel, collective, social movements which are practicing alternatives to the mainstream models of production, distribution, and consumption. Farmers markets, solidarity-based purchasing groups, box scheme, shopping groups, 'pick your own', social shopping, are all examples of sustainable consumption patterns involving thousands of people seeking quality and ethical products and services at the best price. While a variety of definitions of the concept of ethical consumption have been suggested, throughout this paper it will refer to the participation of consumers in, and their orientation toward, political discourses on sustainable and fair agro-food production. Ethical consumption attitude has been analysed in the framework of political consumerism theory by administering six focus groups among Italian participants of a specific form of collective action, namely the solidarity-based purchasing group. Findings provide insights that represent a fruitful starting point for deepening the analysis of ethical consumers' behaviour at a broader level in order to sustain and spread eco-socially production practices and ethical consumption behaviour.

AB Car-sharing system with electric cars is a very convenient service for urban transportation: it allows users to pick up a vehicle at a station and rent it during a short time. To manage this kind of system in the best way, it is necessary to solve the critical problem of vehicle stock imbalance across the stations. Several decision levels must be considered to balance the car distribution by taking into account the quality of service and the system operation cost. To this end, a linear programming model is proposed to formalize the problem in a mathematical framework, which allows the computation of optimal vehicle distribution strategies. To make our solution time efficient and usable for solving large problems, a greedy algorithm and a tabu search algorithm are proposed. These two algorithms are applied to the Auto Bleue network in Nice and its surrounding (France) using extensive simulations. Besides, an integrated mapping method is provided within the Geographical Information System QGIS to estimate flows and their locations. Numerical results demonstrate that the tabu search algorithm is able to find near-optimal solutions and good compromises between client satisfaction, number of staff agents and vehicles used, and computing time.

AB Human travel behaviour has recently been one of the most popular topics in transport studies. Therefore, the ability to obtain valuable sets of data has become one of the key challenges for researchers. Traditional mobility surveys have many important limitations. In this situation, the potential of the use of smartphones and dedicated applications in the identification of individual travel behaviour seem very promising. We set ourselves a goal to indicate strengths and weaknesses of data obtained with this method and assess the perspectives of its use for the needs of public policies. For these purposes we prepared a low-cost mobile application and conducted a pilot study among students in Poznan (Poland). In effect, trajectories of more than 100 people with almost 3 billion of location data were collected. Based on a literature review and our results we discuss the main problems, limitations and challenges of the broader use of the data obtained with smartphones. In the conclusion, we argue that there is a huge and increasing potential connected with mobile phones, but still some important barriers exist including sampling problems, limitations in big data analyses and technological issues. Therefore, a broader use of smartphones in travel behaviour surveys seems to be rather a distant perspective.

AB Cognitive function is a critical health issue in later life, the decline of which disrupts well-being and daily life function. Cognitive decline in older ages can also be understood in the context of the social environment such as social connectedness and engagement in personal life. This study aimed to examine: (1) whether participation in social activities contributes to preventing cognitive decline, and (2) what type of social activities are beneficial to maintaining cognitive function. Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLOSA) 2006-2014, a longitudinal survey of the household-dwelling population aged 45 and older in Korea were used. The results revealed that Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores decreased with increasing age, at a rate of approximately 0.18 units across all age-gender groups, and the decrease was steeper for adults aged 65 and over. Participation in social gatherings was likely to delay the decline in cognitive function after the age of 65. In a gender-stratified model, social activity may not have an impact on the decline of cognitive function for men, whereas participation in social gatherings was negatively related to the decline of MMSE scores in women. This study suggests the need for a gender-stratified policy for preventing the decline of cognitive function while promoting engagement in social activities in Korean older adults.

AB In today's restructuring electricity market, short-term load forecasting (STLF) is an essential tool for the electricity utilities to predict future scenario and act towards a profitable policy. The electric load demand is highly influenced by the thermal inertia due to the climatic factors. These influential climatic factors are different in different regions. Therefore, it is necessary to have a region specific STLF model for load forecasting under regional climatic conditions. This paper proposes a regional hybrid STLF model utilizing SVM with a new technique, called grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), to evaluate its suitable parameters. This study is carried out in Assam, a state of India and proposed GOA-SVM model is targeted for forecasting the load under local climatic conditions. The proposed model uses the similar day approach (SDA) to satisfy the regional climatic requirements. The results of the proposed model show better accuracy comparing to results generated with classical STLF model of incorporating temperature universally as the only climatic factor. To further affirm the efficacy of the proposed model, same inputs are delivered in two alternative hybrid models, namely GA-SVM (GA with SVM) and PSO-SVM (PSO with SVM). The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the other hybrid models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Latin America, shopping malls seem to offer an open, safe and democratic version of the public space. However, it is often difficult to quantitatively measure whether they indeed foster, hinder, or are neutral with respect to social inclusion. In this work, we investigate if, and by how much, people from different social classes are attracted by the same malls. Using a dataset of mobile phone network records from 387,152 devices identified as customers of 16 malls in Santiago de Chile, we performed several analyses to study whether malls with higher social mixing attract more people. Our pipeline, which starts with the socio-economic characterization of mall visitors, includes the estimation of social mixing and diversity of malls, the application of the gravity model of mobility, and the definition of a co-visitation model. Results showed that people tend to choose a profile of malls more in line with their own socio-economic status and the distance from their home to the mall, and that higher mixing does positively contribute to the process of choosing a mall. We conclude that (a) there is social mixing in malls, and (b) that social mixing is a factor at the time of choosing which mall to go to. Thus, the potential for social mixing in malls could be capitalized by designing public policies regarding transportation and mobility to make some malls strong social inclusion hubs.

AB When facing discrete space learning problems, the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms often have the problems of slow convergence and poor convergence accuracy. Deep reinforcement learning needs a large number of learning samples in its learning process, so it often faces with the problems that the algorithm is difficult to converge and easy to fall into local minimums. In view of the above problems, we apply support vector machines classification to reinforcement learning, and propose an algorithm named Advantage Actor-Critic with Support Vector Machine Classification (SVM-A2C). Our algorithm adopts the actor-critic framework and uses the support vector machine classification as a result of the actor's action output, while Critic uses the advantage function to improve and optimize the parameters of support vector machine. In addition, since the environment is changing all the time in reinforcement learning, it is difficult to find a global optimal solution for the support vector machines, the gradient descent method is applied to optimize the parameters of support vector machine. So that the agent can quickly learn a more precise action selection policy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the classical experimental environment of reinforcement learning. It is proved that the algorithm proposed in this paper has shorter episodes to convergence and more accurate results than other algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Uniformity of Terminology for Circular Intersection Designs
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Most transportation engineers around the world, and now in the United States, are relatively familiar with roundabouts and their operational and safety benefits. Although roundabouts are becoming increasingly common, drivers and even engineering professionals often contend with mixed messages about roundabout design and operation. In a world speckled with all manner of spiral roundabouts, signalized roundabouts, traffic circles, gyratories, and rotaries, is it any wonder that confusion, and public resistance, often persists? These mixed messages may represent the greatest hurdle to implementation, public acceptance, and safe operation of multi-lane roundabouts in particular. Within North America and across the globe, circular intersection designs that appear relatively similar to users can in fact require significantly different driver behaviors, depending on whether they are configured with a continuous circle road or a network of crossing roadways. This distinction can be of critical importance for roadway designers and agencies, elected officials and other policymakers, road user education and licensing, traffic enforcement, mapping and GPS navigation, and safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This paper aims to provide an overview of existing definitions, explore the nature of conflict points for each design, provide a framework modeling method for analysis, and provide globally applicable definitions for roundabout features for use in design, education, policy, enforcement, and research. This paper is focused primarily on roundabout design guidance and operations within the United States, but places these practices within the global context, such that the definitions and analyses provided can be applied to all forms of roundabout intersections around the world.

AB Projections of greater interannual and intrannual climate variability, including increasing temperatures, longer and more intense drought periods, and more extreme precipitation events, present growing challenges for agricultural production in the Southern Plains of the USA. We assess agricultural vulnerabilities within this region to support identification and development of adaptation strategies at regional to local scales, where many management decisions are made. Exposure to the synergistic effects of warming, such as fewer and more intense precipitation events and greater overall weather variability, will uniquely affect rain-fed and irrigated cropping, high-value specialty crops, extensive and intensive livestock production, and forestry. Although the sensitivities of various agricultural sectors to climatic stressors can be difficult to identify at regional scales, we summarize that crops irrigated from the Ogallala aquifer possess a high sensitivity; rangeland beef cattle production a low sensitivity; and rain-fed crops, forestry, and specialty crops intermediate sensitivities. Numerous adaptation strategies have been identified, including drought contingency planning, increased soil health, improved forecasts and associated decision support tools, and implementation of policies and financial instruments for risk management. However, the extent to which these strategies are adopted is variable and influenced by both biophysical and socioeconomic considerations. Inadequate local- and regional-scale climate risk and resilience information suggests that climate vulnerability research and climate adaptation approaches need to include bottom-up approaches such as learning networks and peer-to-peer communication.

AB Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain.

AB To effectively address the sustainability crises our planet faces, decision-makers at different levels of government worldwide will have to get a handle on three key challenges: learning from Global North and South initiatives in tandem, taking stock of social innovations alongside technological fixes, and nurturing grassroots sustainable development initiatives next to, or in place of, top-down corporate and government interventions. Current scientific literature and grant-making institutions have often reinforced the compartmentalized fashion in which we learn and draw policy lessons from North/South, social/technical, and bottom-up/top-down sustainability initiatives, including local food system innovations. The strategic levers for global sustainable development lying in-between are thus left out. This paper uses exploratory, multiple case study analysis to address this omission. By concurrently drawing lessons from grassroots innovations in Brazil, New York, and Senegal-three profoundly different socioeconomic and geographic contexts-we identify common pressure points that have enabled local communities to drive system-wide transformations toward climate adaptation, resilience, and sustainability in the agri-food system. The findings of this paper would be of value to scholars, government officials, and community groups engaged in agri-food systems sustainability and interested in the processes of change that have allowed budding innovations to stabilize and scale up.

AB This paper explores how musical performance and expression catalyse rural cultural resourcefulness amidst uncertainty and change. We describe and then challenge conceptions of rural vulnerability and resilience amidst substantial social, environmental and economic change. Rural populations are increasingly constituted as vulnerable subjects within state-expert modelling of economic and environmental resilience. Yet, cultural resources and capacities are seldom acknowledged. Community music provides an often invisible and overlooked example. In rural locations music may struggle to be a commercially viable industry, but takes different forms in diverse community music enterprises, including non-profit clubs, orchestras, ensembles, choirs and festivals. Such enterprises sustain engaged music participation despite challenges of isolation and lack of critical mass, and enable people to adjust to change and develop social networks. In so doing, community music contributes to an evolving, prosaic sense of rural cultural resourcefulness. We document how rural Australian musicians negotiate isolation, distance, and new circumstances, and foster alternative spaces for creativity. Geographic and socioeconomic limitations triggered those with an insatiable desire to make and perform music to create their own opportunities through grassroots creativity. From this quotidian example we challenge state/ expert conceptions of rural resilience. Resourceful creativities - focused on cultural vitality, process and everyday rewards rather than commercial successes - illustrate how rural people sustain cultural life amidst hardship, isolation and change.

AB Throughout the developed world, consumers are increasingly being encouraged to adopt cleaner, more eco-friendly behaviours. However, hybrid car adoption remains low, which impedes the move towards a lower carbon economy. In this paper, we examine the risks and drivers of hybrid car purchases, drawing on consumer behaviour and cultural dimensions theory to account for the heterogeneous, segmented nature of the market. As risk perceptions differ across cultures, and in order to address the lack of cross cultural research on eco-friendly cars, we focus on Australian, South Korean, and Japanese consumers. Based on a survey of 817 respondents we examine how five types of risk (social, psychological, time, financial, and network externalities) and three factors that drive purchasing behaviour (product advantages, product attractiveness, and product superiority) influence consumers perceptions of hybrid cars. Four segments of consumers are identified (pessimists, realists, optimists, and casualists) that also vary according to their environmental self-image, and underlying cultural values. Our results extend theory by incorporating self-image and cultural dimension theories into a multi-country analysis of the risks and drivers of hybrid car adoption. Our findings have practical implications in terms of marketing strategies and potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating risk perceptions and promoting the factors that drive hybrid car adoption.

AB The main aim of this study was to identify the key indicators related to environmental management and sustainability of hotels as perceived by travelers during their trips. The methodology used was a sentiment analysis with an algorithm developed in Python trained with data mining and machine learning, with the MonkeyLearn library in the hotel industry sector under the e-WOM model (e-Word of Mouth). The results with negative, positive and neutral feelings were submitted to a textual analysis with the qualitative analysis software Nvivo Pro 12. The sample consisted of the 25 best hotels in Switzerland according to Traveler's Choice from TripAdvisor ranking 2018 that draws from more than 500,000 reviews. For data extraction, we connected to the TripAdvisor API, obtaining a sample of n = 8331 reviews of the hotels that made up the ranking. The results of the study highlight the key factors related to environmental management detected by travelers during their stay in hotels and can be meaningfully used by managers or hotel managers to improve their services and enhance the value provided by their policies of sustainability and respect for the environment. The limitations of the present study relate to the size of the sample and the number of hotels included in the present analysis.

AB Intelligence can have an extremely high heritability, but also be malleable; a paradox that has been the source of continuous controversy. Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and advance a frequently overlooked solution to the paradox: Intelligence is a trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of hidden gene-environment (GE) networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of "genetic" effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in intelligence, with malleability existing on top of heritability. The evidence covers cognitive gains consequent to adoption/immigration, changes in IQ's heritability across life span and socioeconomic status, gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive decline, and the gains in intelligence from early education. The GE solution has novel implications for enduring problems, including our inability to identify intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ's "missing heritability"), and the loss of initial benefits from early intervention programs (such as "Head Start"). The GE solution can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in impoverished and underprivileged populations.

AB Nowadays, when there is much concern about the demographic decline of Europe and the stringent need for public policies that support intelligent, sustainable, and inclusive growth in times of population ageing, this study aims to validate several hypotheses regarding the post-graduation migration intentions of students in economics. To analyse these intentions in the context of Romanian yearly increases of out-migration flows to Western countries, the answers to the questionnaire used for this study were obtained from three important Romanian universities. Using georeferencing, neural networks-based data mining, and two types of regression analysis, the results represent a relevant contribution to the limited body of literature. They empirically show that motivations and attitudes towards a meritocratic environment for professional advancement, and individual freedom are positive key factors for students' migration intentions after graduation. In addition, the paper emphasises the secondary role of religiosity and intergenerational transfer of parental migration experience. It also finds that, although the income level has some influence on these intentions, its role is far less important than the one emphasised in the specific literature, which leads us to the conclusion that non-economic motivations matter more than the economic ones for the potential decision to migrate after graduation.

AB In recent years, cultural sustainability has attracted increasing attention within the discourse of sustainable development and sustainable cities. Notwithstanding some effort put on conceptualizing the relationship between culture and sustainability, research on the issue is still in a pre-paradigmatic stage and related empirical studies are scant. In particular, further knowledge is required to understand not only how cultural sustainability has been addressed strategically but also implemented in practice. In this direction, research has pointed out the role of social structures (e.g., partnerships, collaborations, etc.) for achieving cultural sustainability goals. However, focusing on smart cities, attention is limited to how collaborative arrangements can be leveraged within the development of new city services (e.g., smart open innovation) to sustain goals of environmental, economic and social sustainability, with cultural sustainability still playing a marginal role. This paper develops a new framework linking together the strategic level and the practice level in addressing cultural sustainability and conceptualizing the role of collaborative structures in the development of smart innovation. The framework is then used as a frame of reference for analyzing the case of MuseoTorino, a new city museum realized within the smart city strategy of Turin (Italy). The analysis provides evidence of some practices adopted to leverage collaboration and stakeholders' engagement to strategically address cultural sustainability and to realize it in practice throughout the new service development process.

AB Since its initial introduction in the 1970s, the field of environmental justice (EJ) continues to grow, with significant contributions from the disciplines of sustainability science, geography, political science, public policy and administration, urban planning, law, and many others. Each of these disciplines approach EJ research from slightly different perspectives, but all offer unique and valuable insight to the EJ knowledge domain. Although the interdisciplinary nature of environmental justice should be viewed as a strength, it presents a challenge when attempting to both summarize and synthesize key contributions to the field, due to disciplinary bias, narrow subfield foci, or gaps in knowledge by a research team without a representative disciplinary composition. The purpose of this paper is to provide a succinct, panoptic review of key research contributions to environmental justice, while simultaneously minimizing common problems associated with traditional reviews. In particular, this paper explores the utility of co-citation network analysis, to provide insight into the most important subdomains of environmental justice research. The results suggest that while early EJ research is initially focused on environmental disamenities and a continued focus on race and inequality, the research gradually shifts to foci more concerned with environmental amenities, such as parks and greenspace. We also find that race and inequality remain an important and consist line of research over the duration of the study time period. Implications for environmental justice research and its allied subfields are discussed.

TI A systematic approach to analyze the social determinants of

ID VISUALIZATION; CYTOSCAPE; RISK
AB Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of human mortality worldwide. Among the many factors associated with the etiology, incidence, and evolution of such diseases; social and environmental issues constitute an important and often overlooked component. Understanding to a greater extent the scope to which such social determinants of cardiovascular diseases (SDCVD) occur as well as the connections among them would be useful for public health policy making. Here, we will explore the historical trends and associations among the main SDCVD in the published literature. Our aim will be finding meaningful relations among those that will help us to have an integrated view on this complex phenomenon by providing historical context and a relational framework. To uncover such relations, we used a data mining approach to the current literature, followed by network analysis of the interrelationships discovered. To this end, we systematically mined the PubMed/MEDLINE database for references of published studies on the subject, as outlined by the World Health Organization's framework on social determinants of health. The analyzed structured corpus consisted in circa 1190 articles categorized by means of the Medical Subheadings (MeSH) content-descriptor. The use of data analytics techniques allowed us to find a number of non-trivial connections among SDCVDs. Such relations may be relevant to get a deeper understanding of the social and environmental issues associated with cardiovascular disease and are often overlooked by traditional literature survey approaches, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

AB Hypotheses that megafires, very large, high-impact fires, are caused by either climate effects such as drought or fuel accumulation due to fire exclusion with accompanying changes to forest structure have long been alleged and guided policy, but their physical basis remains untested. Here, unique airborne observations and microscale simulations using a coupled weather-wildland-fire-behavior model allowed a recent megafire, the King Fire, to be deconstructed and the relative impacts of forest structure, fuel load, weather, and drought on fire size, behavior, and duration to be separated. Simulations reproduced observed details including the arrival at an inclined canyon, a 25-km run, and later slower growth and features. Analysis revealed that fire-induced winds that equaled or exceeded ambient winds and fine-scale airflow undetected by surface weather networks were primarily responsible for the fire's rapid growth and size. Sensitivity tests varied fuel moisture and amount across wide ranges and showed that both drought and fuel accumulation effects were secondary, limited to sloped terrain where they compounded each other, and, in this case, unable to significantly impact the final extent. Compared to standard data, fuel models derived solely from remote sensing of vegetation type and forest structure improved simulated fire progression, notably in disturbed areas, and the distribution of burn severity. These results point to self-reinforcing internal dynamics rather than external forces as a means of generating this and possibly other outlier fire events. Hence, extreme fires need not arise from extreme fire environment conditions. Kinematic models used in operations do not capture fire-induced winds and dynamic feedbacks so can underestimate megafire events. The outcomes provided a nuanced view of weather, forest structure, fuel accumulation, and drought impacts on landscape-scale fire behaviorroles that can be misconstrued using correlational analyses between area burned and macroscale climate data or other exogenous factors. A practical outcome is that fuel treatments should be focused on sloped terrain, where factors multiply, for highest impact.

AB Grassland ecosystems worldwide are confronted with degradation. It is of great importance to understand long-term trajectory patterns of grassland vegetation by advanced analytical models. This study proposes a new approach called a binary logistic regression model with neighborhood interactions, or BLR-NIs, which is based on binary logistic regression (BLR), but fully considers the spatio-temporally localized spatial associations or characterization of neighborhood interactions (NIs) in the patterns of grassland vegetation. The BLR-NIs model was applied to a modeled vegetation degradation of grasslands in the Xilin river basin, Inner Mongolia, China. Residual trend analysis on the normalized difference vegetation index (RESTREND-NDVI), which excluded the climatic impact on vegetation dynamics, was adopted as a preprocessing step to derive three human-induced trajectory patterns (vegetation degradation, vegetation recovery, and no significant change in vegetation) during two consecutive periods, T-1 (2000-2008) and T-2 (2007-2015). Human activities, including livestock grazing intensity and transportation accessibility measured by road network density, were included as explanatory variables for vegetation degradation, which was defined for locations if vegetation recovery or no significant change in vegetation in T-1 and vegetation degradation in T-2 were observed. Our work compared the results of BLR-NIs and the traditional BLR model that did not consider NIs. The study showed that: (1) both grazing intensity and road density had a positive correlation to vegetation degradation based on the traditional BLR model; (2) only road density was found to positively correlate to vegetation degradation by the BLR-NIs model; NIs appeared to be critical factors to predict vegetation degradation; and (3) including NIs in the BLR model improved the model performance substantially. The study provided evidence for the importance of including localized spatial associations between the trajectory patterns for mapping vegetation degradation, which has practical implications for designing management policies to counterpart grassland degradation in arid and semi-arid areas.

AB The inhabited zone of the Ugandan Rwenzori Mountains is affected by landslides, frequently causing loss of life, damage to infrastructure and loss of livelihood. This area of ca. 1230 km(2) is characterized by contrasting geomorphologic, climatic and lithological patterns, resulting in different landslide types. In this study, the spatial pattern of landslide susceptibility is investigated based on an extensive field inventory constructed for five representative areas within the region (153 km(2)) and containing over 450 landslides. To achieve a reliable susceptibility assessment, the effects of (1) using different topographic data sources and spatial resolutions and (2) changing the scale of assessment by comparing local and regional susceptibility models on the susceptibility model performances are investigated using a pixel-based logistic regression approach. Topographic data are extracted from different digital elevation models (DEMs) based on radar interferometry (SRTM and TanDEM-X) and optical stereophotogrammetry (ASTER DEM). Susceptibility models using the radar-based DEMs tend to outperform the ones using the ASTER DEM. The model spatial resolution is varied between 10, 20, 30 and 90 m. The optimal resolution depends on the location of the investigated area within the region but the lowest model resolution (90 m) rarely yields the best model performances while the highest model resolution (10 m) never results in significant increases in performance compared to the 20 m resolution. Models built for the local case studies generally have similar or better performances than the regional model and better reflect site-specific controlling factors. At the regional level the effect of distinguishing landslide types between shallow and deep-seated landslides is investigated. The separation of landslide types allows us to improve model performances for the prediction of deep-seated landslides and to better understand factors influencing the occurrence of shallow landslides such as tangent curvature and total rainfall. Finally, the landslide susceptibility assessment is overlaid with a population density map in order to identify potential landslide risk hotspots, which could direct research and policy action towards reduced landslide risk in this under-researched, landslide-prone region.

TI Impacts of roundabouts on urban air quality: A case study of Keene, New

AB Roundabouts have been slow to diffuse across the United States. While roundabouts have been shown to provide safety and emissions benefits to those in or adjacent to an intersection, it is not clear if converting intersections to roundabouts can provide environmental benefits to a larger geographic area. One place where roundabouts have gained favor is the small thriving city of Keene, New Hampshire (pop. 23,409). Most of developed Keene sits in a valley surrounded by steep hills that limit air circulation and have repeatedly resulted in particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) levels exceeding national standards. In 2006-2007, two of Keene's failing signalized intersections (Level of Service "F") were converted to roundabouts. This study seeks to understand how local air quality may have changed in the time since converting to roundabouts. A before-and-after comparison was performed using data gathered by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services from 1999-2014. In the time period following roundabout conversion, ozone levels stayed the same but PM2.5 levels were as much as 40% lower. As a related result, the proportion of the year that was classified as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" or "Unhealthy" was 0.3-1.8% lower in the "after" time period as well. Installing roundabouts at both of its signalized intersections prone to traffic delays appears to have generated air quality benefits for Keene. While PM2.5 levels were lower in adjacent neighborhoods, this benefit may be more pronounced in a place like Keene with a similar geographic setting in terms of development patterns, transport network and topographic conditions. As planners and policy-makers propose roundabouts to relieve congestion and improve safety, this research provides additional evidence that the benefits of doing so can extend beyond the immediate intersection in certain communities; particularly when a community simultaneously installs roundabouts at all of its failing signalized intersections.

AB Sustainability assessment and sustainability indicators are familiar terms that have gained significant importance. Non-compliance between the sustainable development principles and transportation infrastructure projects is changing the appearance of historic cities from livable and vibrant atmosphere into the car-oriented condition and cause environmental and social problems. There exist numerous studies on measuring the sustainability of transportation at the country, state, city, and even traffic zone levels, but few have addressed the sustainability of micro-scale projects. The objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of infrastructure projects on urban transportation systems and evaluate their compliance with principles of sustainable development. According to made intensive field visits, run expert interviews, and development master plans relevant to the case study, nine scenarios are proposed to improve the traffic situation of Azadi district in Isfahan city. Obviously, a slight change in the urban streets network, would have a significant effect on traffic performance in larger area, therefore, all the proposed scenarios are modeled in Trans Cad 5.0 software environment to determine their influence area (IA) as the study area. Ten quantitative indicators in three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) pertinent to the urban transportation are selected based on review of the related literature and available data in Isfahan. The IA and all proposed scenarios are simulated and calibrated in AIMSUN 8.0 environment and the indicators are quantified in a direct and indirect manner through AIMSUN outputs. A composite sustainability index (CSI) is applied for integrating the effects of selected indicators based on their rankings given by the experts regarding to the goals of Isfahan vision in 2025. The results indicate that public transportation development projects are the most compliant scenarios with the principles of urban sustainable development and the best options for the future development in Azadi district. This proposed framework, would assist policy-makers and traffic engineers in other cities to evaluate the sustainability of urban transportation infrastructure projects.

AB Analysing the repeated trip behaviour of travellers, including trip frequency and intrapersonal variability, can provide insights into traveller needs, flexibility and knowledge of the network, as well as inputs for models including learning and/or behaviour change. Data from emerging data sources provide new opportunities to examine repeated trip making on the road network. Point-to-point sensor data, for example from Bluetooth detectors, is collected using fixed detectors installed next to roads which can record unique identifiers of passing vehicles or travellers which can then be matched across space and time. Such data is used in this research to segment road users based on their repeated trip making behaviour, as has been done in public transportation research using smart card data to understand different categories of users. Rather than deciding on traveller segmentation based on a priori assumptions, the method provides a data driven approach to cluster together travellers who have similar trip regularity and variability between days. Measures which account for the strengths and weaknesses of point-to-point sensor data are presented for (a) spatial variability, using Sequence Alignment, and (b) time of day variability, using Model Based Clustering. The proposed method is also applied to one year of data from 23 fixed Bluetooth detectors in a town in northwest England. The data consists of almost 7.5 million trips made by over 300,000 travellers. Applying the proposed methods allows three traveller user classes to be identified: infrequent, frequent, and very frequent. Interestingly, the spatial and time of day variability characteristics of each user class are distinct and are not linearly correlated with trip frequency. The frequent travellers are observed 1-5 times per week on average and make up 57% of the trips recorded during the year. Focusing on these frequent travellers, it is shown that these can be further separated into those with high spatial and time of day variability and those with low spatial and time of day variability. Understanding the distribution of travellers and trips across these user classes, as well as the repeated trip characteristics of each user class, can inform further data collection and the development of policies targeting the needs of specific travellers.

AB Interest in eco-innovation in the corporate environment has grown considerably in recent years. Given the profound role of eco-innovation, it is therefore important to obtain a better understanding on the latest research progress in the academia and the recent organizational efforts in practice. This review paper addresses this need and contributes to the current literature in three ways. First, this paper presents a descriptive overview on eco-innovation in the corporate environment by examining 395 representative articles published from 2006 to 2015, collected from the Social Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. The characteristics of the terminologies and journals, prevailing themes and changes, the geographical location of prolific authors and main geographical context of research studies in eco-innovation are identified to unravel the evolution of the concerned research studies and institutional contexts. Second, by using co-word and social network analyses, this study finds that the current literature on eco-innovation in the corporate environment is mainly focused on nine areas, including the influence of stakeholders, drivers of eco-innovation, eco-innovation systems, eco-design, new product developments, product service systems, environmental management systems, green supply chain management, and performance & small medium enterprises (SMEs). Third, this study provides an extended conceptual framework that incorporates the notion of 'driver -> source -> position -> performance' (D -> S -> P -> P) to find the relationships among the research topics in the eco-innovation field. This framework allows examination of the overall strategies for eco-innovation in the corporate environment so that a firm can gain a competitive edge through their adoption, implementation, assessment, and investment. This systematic review will benefit practitioners and academics by providing the major strands of research in the current studies on eco-innovation. This study also provides insights into four distinctive features of eco-innovation in the corporate environment as well as research gaps of recent eco-innovation studies. This study thus provides future research directions for subsequent eco-innovation research, as well as insights for managers and policy makers on how to enhance and strategize strategies for eco-innovation in the corporate environment.

AB Over the last 6 years, a coordinated "healthy corner store" network has helped an increasing number of local storeowners stock healthy, affordable foods in Camden, New Jersey, a city with high rates of poverty and unemployment, and where most residents have little or no access to large food retailers. The initiative's funders and stakeholders wanted to directly engage Camden residents in evaluating this effort to increase healthy food access. In a departure from traditional survey-or focus group-based evaluations, we used an evidence-based community-engaged citizen science research model (called Our Voice) that has been deployed in a variety of neighborhood settings to assess how different features of the built environment both affect community health and wellbeing, and empower participants to create change. Employing the Our Voice model, participants documented neighborhood features in and around Camden corner stores through geo-located photos and audio narratives. Eight adult participants who lived and/or worked in a predefined neighborhood of Camden were recruited by convenience sample and visited two corner stores participating in the healthy corner store initiative (one highly-engaged in the initiative and the other less-engaged), as well as an optional third corner store of their choosing. Facilitators then helped participants use their collected data (in total, 134 images and 96 audio recordings) to identify and prioritize issues as a group, and brainstorm and advocate for potential solutions. Three priority themes were selected by participants from the full theme list (n = 9) based on perceived importance and feasibility: healthy product selection and display, store environment, and store outdoor appearance and cleanliness. Participants devised and presented a set of action steps to community leaders, and stakeholders have begun to incorporate these ideas into plans for the future of the healthy corner store network. Key elements of healthy corner stores were identified as positive, and other priorities, such as improvements to safety, exterior facades, and physical accessibility, may find common ground with other community development initiatives in Camden. Ultimately, this pilot study demonstrated the potential of citizen science to provide a systematic and data-driven process for public health stakeholders to authentically engage community residents in program evaluation.

TI Making sense of team integration practice through the "lived experience"

AB Purpose Team integration is a concept that has been widely fostered in alliances as a way of improving collaborative relationships between diverse organisations. However, deeper insights into the practice of high levels of team integration remain elusive. The purpose of this paper is to develop a deeper understanding of team integration through the lived experience of practitioners in an alliance.
   Design/methodology/approach This study employed a qualitative research methodology. Using a phenomenological examination, via the lived experiences of 24 alliance practitioners, the practice of alliance team integration has been investigated based on the key indicators that foster alliance team integration: team leadership, trust and respect, single team focus on project objectives and key results areas, collective understanding, commitment from project alliance board, single and co-located alliance team, and free flow communication.
   Findings The findings highlight that alliancing gives the project teams' flexibility to change and adapt, to advance the collaborative environment and that successful integration of multi-disciplinary project teams requires commitment to the identified indicators. These findings have led to the development of a framework of leadership for successful alliance integrated practices. It is proposed that to influence the leadership for the purpose of achieving successful integration practice, a team-centric approach is required which includes four elements: task and relationship-oriented behaviours; collaborative learning environments; cultivating cross-boundary networks; and collaborative governance.
   Practical implications As team integration is the central tenet of alliance projects, greater understanding regarding the leadership of integration practice is of value in leveraging the benefits of outstanding performance. Also, the results of the study are expected to be informative and provide insight for alliance teams to help them proactively recognise how the context of integrated teams is influenced by specific indicators, impacting on the extent of integration practice.
   Originality/value This study contributes to the current body of knowledge concerning the insights from the lived experience of alliance teams towards achieving a greater understanding of what contributes to the leadership of successful integration practices.

AB Purpose International marketing (IM) researchers have underscored the need for scholars to develop more studies to investigate institutional interactions (II) and sources of complexities in emerging markets (EMs). In response to these calls, the purpose of this paper is to propose a framework that classifies the dominant conditions firms are likely to confront as they enter EMs. Further, using exploratory data, the study evaluates potential strategies that foreign firms can follow when they encounter one of the most challenging condition (tribal rule (TR)) identified in the framework. The primary research question explored is: what strategies do foreign firms adopt to succeed under conditions of TR in EMs?
   Design/methodology/approach The methodology is exploratory qualitative research. The authors conducted extended interviews to produce rich case study data from CEOs and executives who have experience doing business in countries with strong TR conditions, such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The interview data/transcripts were evaluated using open, axial, and selective coding (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) to discover macro-narratives that guide entry strategies in EMs.
   Findings Overall, foreign firms successful strategies under TR conditions revolve around knowledge of tribal networks, understanding of their common interests, co-creation of commonality of interests and goals and internal assimilation of tribal leaders. Based on the findings, the authors argue strategies emphasizing co-creation of commonality of interest and goals and absorption of political risk environment perspective will outperform traditional standardization and relational trust approaches.
   Practical implications The findings from the study provided preliminary insights about relevant managerial strategic choices under conditions of tribal complexities.
   Originality/value This study is the first known study to expand the recent IM debate on II and sources of complexities to TR context. The recognition of a co-creation of commonality of interest dimension is an important contribution. The strategy of co-creation of commonality of interests is unique to this study.

AB Objective: The aim of this review was to examine the migration motives, the barriers to and facilitators of integration of international dental graduates, compared with nurses and doctors in the United Kingdom.
   Methods: Electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Knowledge and OECD publications were systematically searched for English language publications from January 2000 to January 2017. A total of 31 qualitative studies were selected and quality appraised and meta-synthesis of the qualitative data was carried out using framework synthesis. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were applied to present the findings.
   Results: There were no studies on migration motives and one study on integration experiences of international dentists in the UK. The nursing literature had the highest volume and quality of evidence on nursing workforce, whilst there was limited literature on international doctors in the UK. Migration of health professionals to the UK is determined by personal and professional factors, together with source country-specific and UK drivers. Active recruitment, post graduate training and financial gain act as strong common macro, meso and micro drivers that perpetuate migration into the UK, but the extent to which each of these drivers influence nurses' and doctors' migration is different. Integration experiences for international nurses and doctors differed based on their source country experiences and the work environment they entered. Nurses reported a wider knowledge and skills gap, more multi-level discrimination and less career progression compared to the doctors. The migrants' integration experiences depend on their cultural awareness, discrimination exposure, English language and communication skills, social and professional support networks, social integration and personal attributes.
   Conclusion: Migration of international health professionals is motivated by macro, meso and micro drivers at the international, national, professional and personal levels. The UK has strong common macro pull factors which attract nurses, doctors and dentists and may impact on the effectiveness of policies to restrict their migration. The integration experiences of nurses and doctors differ and further research is required to understand the integration experiences of dentists, in order to retain these professionals by tailoring policies to each of these professions.

AB Quantitative analysis of consequences (in terms of expected monetary losses) induced by slow-moving landslide mechanisms to buildings or infrastructure networks is a key step in the landslide risk management framework. It can influence risk mitigation policies as well as help authorities in charge of land management in addressing/prioritizing interventions or restoration works. This kind of analysis generally requires multidisciplinary approaches, which cannot disregard a thorough knowledge of landslide mechanisms, and rich datasets that are seldom available as testified by the limited number of examples in the scientific literature. With reference to the well-documented case study of Lungro town (Calabria region, southern Italy)-severely affected by slow-moving landslides of different types-the present paper proposes and implements a multi-step procedure for monetary loss forecasting associated with different landslide kinematic/damage scenarios. Procedures to typify landslide mechanisms and physical vulnerability analysis, previously tested in the same area, are here appropriately merged to derive both kinematic and damage scenarios to the exposed buildings. Then, the outcomes are combined with economic data in order to forecast monetary loss at municipal scale. The proposed method and the obtained results, once further validated, could stand as reference case for other urban areas in similar geo-environmental contexts in order to derive useful information on expected direct consequences unless slow-moving landslide risk mitigation measures are taken.

AB Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are designed to work well in static environments. In many real-world scenarios, the environments are complex and dynamic, in which the performance of traditional RL approaches may drastically degrade. One of the factors which results in the dynamicity and complexity of the environment is a change in the position and number of obstacles. This paper presents a path planning approach for autonomous mobile robots in a complex dynamic indoor environment, where the dynamic pattern of obstacles will not drastically affect the performance of RL models. Two independent modules, collision avoidance without considering the goal position and goal-seeking without considering obstacles avoidance, are trained independently using artificial neural networks and RL to obtain their best control policies. Then, a switching function is used to combine the two trained modules for realizing the obstacle avoidance and global path planning in a complex dynamic indoor environment. Furthermore, this control system is designed with a special focus on the computational and memory requirements of resource-constrained robots. The design was tested in a real-world environment on a mini-robot with constrained resources. Along with the static and dynamic obstacles' avoidance, this system has the ability to achieve both static and dynamic targets. This control system can also be used to train a robot in the real world using RL when the robot cannot afford to collide. Robot behavior in the real ground shows a very strong correlation with the simulation results.

AB Under the background of social transformation and space reconstruction, population aging in China is becoming more and more diverse and complex. "Aging before getting rich", a notion in population and economic development, has been a serious threat to sustainable development in China. On the basis of town- and street block-scale data from the Fifth and Sixth National Census in the Yangtze River Delta, we studied spatial distribution characteristics of population aging using global Moran's I and hotspot analysis, and applied the geographical detector technique to explain the spatial heterogeneity of population aging. Several conclusions were drawn. (1) The promotion and replacement of aging coexist. Cluster of aging degree exhibits an increasing trend. Population aging is more severe in suburban areas than urban areas. (2) Migration is the main factor affecting the spatial heterogeneity of population aging. Per capital GDP and road network density are the second most influential factors. By contrast, the relief degree of land surface and the air quality index minimally influence population aging. The mechanisms of aging in various regions are affected by varying development levels. (3) The interaction among social, economic, and environmental factors enhances their effects and, thus, interacting factors have a greater influence on population aging than any single factor. The findings of this study have significant implications for local inhabitants and policy makers to address the population aging challenge in achieving sustainability of society, economy, and environment.

AB High-speed rail is frequently claimed to have a transformative effect on the economy. By bringing cities and regions closer together it is argued that economies can benefit from lower generalised costs of transport leading to enhanced growth and productivity. A counter argument is that such effects are largely redistributive with some regions benefiting and others suffering depending on their ability to take advantage of new opportunities. However, some argue further than this and claim that such step changes in transport provision can lead to major changes in economic structure that can transform regions' absolute as well as relative position and thus redress the existence of regional disparities.
   In this paper, we address the question as to whether there is a clear and robust economic theory of the transformational impact of high-speed rail and if there is any consistent evidence to support it? The paper uses evidence from the North-west European High-Speed Rail network and a more detailed study of the UK's first highspeed line, HS1. This is followed by a discussion of the various claims and counter-claims for the impact of the proposed HS2 that will link London with Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. On the basis of this some of the implications for the appraisal of such projects are considered. The main conclusion from the paper is that transport infrastructure by itself is not likely to be transformative, but coupled with other policy interventions it can contribute to such an effect.

AB The demand for urban mobility has seen a marked increase over the last few decades. The expansion of road networks, the increase in distance traveled and in the number of trips made has created car-dependent cities. One solution for achieving the switch from private car to public transport is the introduction of a new public transport line that improves the accessibility and frequency of service. However, an important behavioral process underpins travel choices and often a change in choice context is not sufficient to evoke behavior change. Voluntary travel behavior change (VTBC) programs were developed for heightening individuals' awareness of the consequences of their travel choices and of the benefits to be reaped from using sustainable alternatives, through information provision and communication strategies. The objective of the present paper is to analyze the effect on travel mode choice of introducing a new light railway line into the choice set (hard measure) when implementing a VTBC program on a large scale, but with a high degree of personalization (soft measure). Although numerous studies have demonstrated the need to implement a (hard) measure that acts on the choice context, in combination with a (soft) measure that acts in a personalized way on demand, as far as the authors are aware, few have put this into practice. The first results have shown that a combination of hard and soft measures is more effective in evoking travel behavior change and personalized travel plans produce better results than generalized soft measures.

AB Municipal solid waste management represents an increasingly significant environmental, fiscal, and social challenge for cities. Understanding patterns of municipal waste generation behavior at the household and building scales is a critical component of efficient collection routing and the design of incentives to encourage recycling and composting. However, high spatial resolution estimates of building refuse and recycling have been constrained by the lack of granular data for individual properties. This paper presents a new analytical approach, which combines machine learning and small area estimation techniques, to predict weekly and daily waste generation at the building scale. Using daily collection data from 609 New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) sub-sections over ten years, together with detailed data on individual building attributes, neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, weather, and selected route-level collection data, we apply gradient boosting regression trees and neural network models to estimate daily and weekly refuse and recycling tonnages for each of the more than 750,000 residential properties in the City. Following cross-validation and a two-stage spatial validation, our results indicate that our method is capable of predicting building-level waste generation with a high degree of accuracy. Our methodology has the potential to support collection truck route optimization based on expected building-level waste generation rates, and to facilitate new equitable solid waste management policies to shift behavior and divert waste from landfills based on benchmarking and peer performance comparisons.

AB Waiting time at public transport stops is perceived by passengers to be more onerous than in vehicle time, hence it strongly influences the attractiveness and use of public transport. Transport models traditionally assume that average waiting times are half the service headway by assuming random passenger arrivals. However, research agree that two distinct passenger behaviour types exist: one group arrives randomly, whereas another group actively tries to minimise their waiting time by arriving in a timely manner at the scheduled departure time. This study proposes a general framework for estimating passenger waiting times which incorporates the arrival patterns of these two groups explicitly, namely by using a mixture distribution consisting of a uniform and a beta distribution. The framework is empirically validated using a large-scale automatic fare collection system from the Greater Copenhagen Area covering metro, suburban, and regional rail stations thereby giving a range of service headways from 2 to 60 min. It was shown that the proposed mixture distribution is superior to other distributions proposed in the literature. This can improve waiting time estimations in public transport models. The results show that even at 5-min headways 43% of passengers arrive in a timely manner to stations when timetables are available. The results bear important policy implications in terms of providing actual timetables, even at high service frequencies, in order for passengers to be able to minimise their waiting times.

AB Selecting a rational large-scale rooftop photovoltaic (LSR-PV) project portfolio is critical to the realization of long-term strategy objectives for PV enterprises. Difficulties related to LSR-PV project portfolio selection result from factors including uncertainties of decision-making environment, various properties of evaluation attributes and interactions between projects. However, the existing researches on portfolio selection have not solved these problems well. In this work, combining of fuzzy multi-attribute decision making and fuzzy multi-objective programming, an integrated framework is proposed to address these issues simultaneously. First, the assessment values of attributes, objective functions and constrains all take the form of triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs) to fully describe the uncertainties inherent to LSR-PV project portfolio selection. Later, the weights of attributes determined by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are incorporated within PROMETHEE II method to sort the LSR-PV project alternatives by selecting preference functions and setting parameters for each attribute. Then, a fuzzy 0-1 programming model is formulated and the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) algorithm is introduced to capture an optimal-Pareto set under objectives of benefit maximization and installed capacity maximization. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study of Zhejiang province is conducted and a comparative analysis is carried out. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Well-designed and supported innovation niches may facilitate transitions towards sustainable agricultural futures, which may follow different approaches and paradigms such as agroecology, local place-based food systems, vertical farming, bioeconomy, urban agriculture, and smart fanning or digital farming. In this paper we consider how the existing agricultural innovation systems (AIS) approach might be opened up to better support the creation of innovation niches. We engage with Innovation Ecosystems thinking to consider the ways in which it might enhance efforts to create multi-actor, cross-sectoral innovation niches that are capable of supporting transitions to sustainable agricultural systems across multiple scales. While sharing many similarities with MS thinking, Innovation Ecosystems thinking has the potential to broaden MS by: emphasizing the role of power in shaping directionality in innovation platforms or innovation communities that are connected to niches and their interaction with regimes; highlighting the plurality of actors and actants and the integral role of ecological actants in innovation; and offering an umbrella concept through which to cross scalar and paradigmatic or sector boundaries in order to engage with a variety of innovation systems affecting multifunctional agricultural landscapes and systems. To this end, an Agricultural Innovation Ecosystems approach may help design and support development of transboundary, inter-sectoral innovation niches that can realize more collective and integrated innovation

AB Public transport is designed to move people efficiently and affordably around their communities. Millions of people internationally with disabilities rely on public transport every day to connect them to services, work, educational and social events. Many of these people attempt to board public transport using a powered mobility aid (such as an electric wheelchair, mobility scooter, or gopher) and this number is expected to rise as the population ages. Evidence suggests that many people have difficulty getting their powered mobility aids on and off public transport vehicles, and consumers, vendors and the health care-professionals involved in recommending mobility aids have no way of knowing which powered mobility aids are compatible with existing public transport configurations. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how existing 3D technologies and software can be applied to solve this real world problem using the example of buses. This proof-of-principle paper describes the process of scanning buses and powered mobility aids in 3D, together with descriptions of the prototype software to undertake the computerised process, to determine the compatibility of powered mobility aids for access on buses. Feasibility is then demonstrated using an example of one bus and one powered mobility aid. This paper is of interest to researchers wishing to examine the application of 3D technologies, health care providers and consumers who select powered mobility aids, as well as transport policy makers and conveyance commissioners who can access 3D data to optimise transport network accessibility for all community members.

AB This paper explores the opportunities for innovation and diversification that can be opened in association to mining activities in developing countries. In particular, the paper focuses on Knowledge Intensive Mining Suppliers (KIMS) in Chile. Using case study methodology, results show that Chilean KIMS firms entered dynamic segments of the Chilean copper value chain either by customizing products and services to local productive specific conditions or by utilizing new technologies as a platform to develop unique solutions to unresolved mining problems. In the former case, Chilean KIMS are small to large firms with a family origin which entered consolidated markets dominated by large international supplies, whereas in the latter one these suppliers are small young firms which were created as scientific or corporate spin-offs that opened new market niches. Linkages with leading mining firms that governed the mining value chain have been crucial for Chilean KIMS to learn about industry needs. However, there is no evidence that indicates that these linkages have been significant in helping local suppliers to construe their technological and innovative capabilities. Instead, Chilean KIMS innovated in isolation and only occasionally received technological assistance from extra-industry organizations. Experimentation in mine sites is the most important bottleneck for Chilean KIMS' innovation strategy. Governments seeking to support the expansion of RIMS need a good understanding of these companies' innovation trajectory, competitive environment, threats, risks and opportunities.

AB Objectives: The University of Minnesota (UMN) Health Sciences Libraries conducted a needs assessment of public health researchers as part of a multi-institutional study led by Ithaka S+R. The aims of the study were to capture the evolving needs, opportunities, and challenges of public health researchers in the current environment and provide actionable recommendations. This paper reports on the data collected at the UMN site.
   Methods: Participants (n=24) were recruited through convenience sampling. One-on-one interviews, held November 2016 to January 2017, were audio-recorded. Qualitative analyses were conducted using NVivo 11 Pro and were based on the principles of grounded theory.
   Results: The data revealed that a broad range of skill levels among participants (e.g., literature searching) and areas of misunderstanding (e.g., current publishing landscape, open access options). Overall, data management was an afterthought. Few participants were fully aware of the breadth of librarian knowledge and skill sets, although many did express a desire for further skill development in information science.
   Conclusions: Libraries can engage more public health researchers by utilizing targeted and individualized marketing regarding services. We can promote open science by educating researchers on publication realities and enhancing our data visualization skills. Libraries might take an institution-wide leadership role on matters of data management and data policy compliance. Finally, as team science emerges as a research priority, we can offer our networking expertise. These support services may reduce the stresses that public health researchers feel in the current research environment.

ID WICKED PROBLEMS
AB The increasing recognition globally of the difficulties faced by local governments in their attempts to address the complex nature of urban policy has led to engaged scholarship and knowledge co-production increasingly being invoked. To better understand how knowledge partnerships are formed, sustained and the (perceived) benefits of such knowledge configurations, this paper draws on the knowledge transfer programme (KTP). The KTP (2012-2015) was a partnership between academic researchers at the University of Cape Town and city practitioners at the City of Cape Town, based on the assumption that a single knowledge base is not sufficient to respond to the changing nature of urban and environmental change. The benefit of partnerships and the collaborative approach used in the KTP are detailed. Using qualitative research methods, it is argued that more engaged interactions, including knowledge co-production approaches between the researchers and the practitioners generates multiple benefits. Whilst the engagement for both institutions lies in the knowledge produced during the interaction, the process of embedding in alternate institutional spaces for sustained periods resulted in building trust, deepening partnerships and surfacing of tacit knowledge. Furthermore, individual benefits accrued by participants including support available to researchers and officials through fostered relationships, access to data and knowledge, improved understanding of urban issues, broadened networks via new partnerships, conceptual reflection and wider knowledge bases through collaboration and embedded research were found to be significant.

AB Historical evaluation and future projection of ecological security have become increasingly important during the past decades. In this study, we establish a framework on historical evaluation and future projection of ecological security. In particular, historical ecological security evaluation based on emergy-ecological footprint, ecological security projection based on emergy-grey model and an emergy-based evaluation indicator system. This framework is applied to China's provincial ecological security evaluation during 2006-2015. In parallel, a potential projection in the future 100 years for the same area is performed. Results show that (1) Ecological deficit exists in economically developed regions, with more developed and relatively concentrated industrial production in the local; (2) Most of China's western provinces are secure, while mid-eastern China provinces are less secure, with the exception of Tianjin (slightly insecure) and Shanghai (extremely insecure). Most of the "two-screens, three-belts" regions are secure or less secure; (3) fossil fuels are the main contributors to the emergy-ecological footprint. (4) Ecological coordination and diversity indexC cannot entirely reflect ecological security; (5) Based on the present knowledge, in the coming 100 years ecological security might get worse in 10 provinces: Shanxi, Shaanxi, Tianjin, Inner Mongolia, Anhui, Hainan, Yunnan, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang. Policy recommendations are, then, raised to improve China's ecological security state. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane systems are considered one of most effective countermeasures to mitigate freeway congestion. Existing studies have largely focused on developing optimal tolling strategies to maximize the benefits of congestion pricing. Limited effort has been made to model the dynamic feedback mechanism of drivers' responses to tolling. A thorough understanding of how the interactive relationship between demands (in both HOT lane and general purpose lanes) and toll rates evolves over time is necessary. The underlying mechanism can be used directly for guiding future HOT facilities investment decisions. This study builds upon the traditional vector autoregressive model and enables its parameters to be time-varying. Such a relaxation, namely, time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR), is used to answer the following two questions: (1) Is there a time varying effect between general purpose lane volume, HOT lane volume and dynamic toll rate? (2) If there is, how to quantify such time-varying interdependencies? Based on the empirical data from loop detectors and toll logs on Washington State Route 167 (SR167), we identified the existence of time-varying effects between drivers' responses and toll rates, and quantified the evolving interactions amongst HOT demand, general purpose demand and tolling via time-varying impulse responses. In addition, we found that drivers' perceptions on HOT lanes across distinct geographical locations are significantly different.

AB For online retailers with attended home delivery business models, the decisive factor for promising dynamic time slot pricing decisions is the quality of the opportunity cost approximation concerning incoming customer requests. For this purpose, we present a novel approximation approach based on mixed-integer linear programming that we integrate into the de facto standard dynamic pricing framework prevalent in the academic literature. Our approximation combines the most current information regarding the customers accepted to date with a forecast of expected customers to come that is adapted during the progress of the booking horizon. Thus, future customer requests demand management, i.e. the consequences of future pricing decisions, is anticipated. We approximate the retailer's vehicle routes and thus delivery costs of expected customers by a dynamic seed-based scheme in which potential seeds' locations as well as related distance approximations are dynamically adjusted under consideration of the locations of already accepted customers. In a computational study, we compare the approach to established pricing approaches in practice and to the state-of-the-art dynamic pricing policy. We show that our approach constantly yields the highest profit, specifically given a tight capacity level. We further provide implications for practical use. We show that, even for large-scale implementations in a real-time environment, our approach is applicable by using parallel computing and by only periodically recalculating opportunity cost. Even then, our approach leads to very good results.

   INTENSIFICATION
AB Green-veining policies aiming at restoring biodiversity in agricultural landscapes mainly focus on the connectivity of semi-natural habitats. However, little is known about the potential role of crop connectivity for the biodiversity using cropped habitats. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of habitat connectivity related to annual crops vs. semi-natural habitats (woody elements) on insect biodiversity (carabid beetles) in agricultural landscapes, considering contrasted groups of species in terms of habitat preference and dispersal ability. Results showed that the spatial configuration and connectivity of annual crops in the landscape (here, up to 500 m) can contribute to increased abundance of some groups of carabid species. Spatial continuities between spring and winter crops (in 250 m radius circles) had beneficial effects on farmland species with low mobility (brachypterous) in maize crops, possibly reflecting resource complementation processes. The connectivity of annual crops also had positive effects on abundances of dimorphic farmland species in maize crops and of forest species in woodland, but at contrasted spatial scales (in 250 m vs. 50 m radius circles respectively). The present study also revealed antagonistic effects of landscape patterns related to both crops (edge length between winter and spring crops) and semi-natural habitats (percent cover of woodland) on farmland and forest species, highlighting critical issues regarding the conservation of such contrasted ecological species groups in agricultural landscapes.

AB Under the background of China's rapid urbanization, study on comparative analysis of the spatial structure of urban agglomerations between China and the US can provide the policy proposals of space optimization for the Chinese government. Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Boswash as study area, we mapped the subpixel-level impervious surface coverage of the BTH and Boswash, respectively, from 1972 to 2011. Further, landscape metrics, gravitational model and spatial analysis were used to analyze the differences of the spatial structures between the BTH and Boswash. The results showed that (1) the area of the impervious surface increased rapidly in the BTH, while those remained stable in the Boswash. (2) The spatial structure of the BTH experienced different periods including isolated cities stage, dual-core cities stage, group cities stage and network-style cities stage, while those of the Boswash was more stable, and its spatial pattern showed a "point-axis" structure. (3) The spatial pattern of high-high assembling regions of the impervious surface exhibited a "standing pancake" feature in the BTH, while those showed a "multi-center, local aggregation and global discrete" feature in the Boswash. (4) All the percentages of the impervious surface of ecological, living, and production land of the BTH were higher than those of the Boswash. At last, from the perspective of space optimization of urban agglomeration, the development proposals for the BTH were proposed.

AB Understanding the formation of interdisciplinary research (IDF) is critically important for the promotion of interdisciplinary development. In this paper, we adopt extracted keywords to investigate the features of interdisciplinarity development, as well as the distinct roles that different participating domains play in various periods, and detect potential barriers among domains. We take joint attention (JA) as the study domain, since it has undergone a development process from a topic of one domain to interdisciplinary research (IDR). Our empirical study has yielded interesting findings. First, we detect the phenomenon of knowledge diffusion as it evolved through three domains of JA. It enabled us to observe the shift of roles the domains played during the process of IDF, as well as the existence of potential barriers among these domains. Second, according to the diffusion and development process of JA among domains, three phases that an IDR field in general goes through were identified: a latent phase, an embryo phase, and a mature phase. Third, domains may play different roles in distinct periods, with the formation of IDR. Four roles are identified: knowledge origin, knowledge receiver, knowledge respondent, and interdisciplinary participant. This paper showcases how to detect the evolution of IDR by analyzing keyword evolution. By giving the profiles of IDR fields and descriptions of keyword evolution, it would be valuable for policy makers and regulators to promote IDR development.

AB The integration of renewable sources into traditional power networks through the development of hybrid systems has attracted increasing international attention. However, simultaneously considering the environmental impacts, the economic benefits, and the natural limits of renewable sources in hybrid systems has proven difficult. This paper proposes an optimal scheduling strategy that fully considers the contributions of wind farm, solar parks, and coal thermal power plants to determine economic benefit and environmental impact equilibrium in a hybrid generation system under natural limitations. By factoring in the seasonal fluctuations in wind power, the weather driven characteristics of solar power, and the fuzzy coal thermal plant parameters, the optimal strategy better depicts the system characteristics than current strategies. A case study from Hami, China is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the optimization model. The calculation results for twelve scheduling scenarios under different wind speeds and weather conditions found that this multi-objective strategy for hybrid generation systems was a superior method for solving the conflicts between emissions reduction and profits under natural renewable source limitations. Compared with previous studies, the optimal strategy this paper proposed is more applicable for developing countries such as China, and provide system operators with less calculation burdens. Management recommendations including the application of equilibrium scheduling strategy, policy support from the government, and improvements in solar power installed capacity have also been proposed.

AB The cloud IaaS provider supports diverse services for users to access big data of the real-time entertainment or the non-real-time working traffic. The IaaS provider builds data centers that include different types cloud resources/equipment, e.g., physical machines, virtual machines, networking, storages, power equipment, etc., and significantly increases cloud cost. An efficient cloud resource management is required for the cloud provider to maximize system reward while satisfying the QoS of various SLAs. This paper proposes a Reward-based adaptive global Cloud Resource Management (RCRM) that consists of three main contributions: the Large-scale and Small-scale traffic Predictions (LSP), Adaptive Cloud resource Allocation, and Maximum Net Profit. The M/M/m/m Markov chain model analyzes the service blocking and the required number of VMs for each request. For maximizing the system net profit, the cloud providers always oversell cloud resources. However, the cost of deploying data centers at different areas in the world is different. This paper adopts the VM migration-in/migration-out and task redirection to adaptively allocate cloud resources among global data centers. Numerical results demonstrate RCRM outperforms the others in dropping probability, SLA violation, violation penalty and net profit. Furthermore, the dropping probability of analysis is very close to that of simulation and justifies the correctness of the proposed Markov chain model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Making Strides: State of the Practice of Pedestrian Forecasting in
   Regional Travel Models
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID ROUTE CHOICE MODEL; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; DEMAND
AB Much has changed in the 30 years since non-motorized modes were first included in regional travel demand models. As interest in understanding behavioral influences on walking and policies requiring estimates of walking activity increase, it is important to consider how pedestrian travel is modeled at a regional level. This paper evaluates the state of the practice of modeling walk trips among the largest 48 metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and assesses changes made over the last 5 years. By reviewing model documentation and responses to a survey of MPO modelers, this paper summarizes current practices, describes six pedestrian modeling frameworks, and identifies trends. Three-quarters (75%) of large MPOs now model non-motorized travel, and over two-thirds (69%) of those MPOs distinguish walking from bicycling; these percentages are up from nearly two-thirds (63%) and one-half (47%), respectively, in 2012. This change corresponds with an increase in the deployment of activity-based models, which offer the opportunity to enhance pedestrian modeling techniques. The biggest barrier to more sophisticated models remains a lack of travel survey data on walking behavior, yet some MPOs are starting to overcome this challenge by oversampling potential active travelers. Decision-makers are becoming more interested in analyzing walking and using estimates of walking activity that are output from models for various planning applications. As the practice continues to mature, the near future will likely see smaller-scale measures of the pedestrian environment, more detailed zonal and network structures, and possibly even an operational model of pedestrian route choice.

AB When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice.
   A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc.
   ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'.
   Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice.
   Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics.
   After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world.
   In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP.
   As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects.
   We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health.
   European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making.
   In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place.
   On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action.
   Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.

AB Innovation platforms have emerged as a way of enhancing the resilience of agricultural and food systems in the face of environmental change. Consequently, a great deal of theoretical reflection and empirical research have been devoted to the goal of understanding the factors that enhance and constrain their functionality. In this article, we further examine this enquiry by applying the concept of institutional embeddedness, understood as encompassing elements of platform design, structure, and functions as well as aspects of the broader historical, political, and social context to which platforms are connected. We present a case study of sub-national platforms established in three districts of the climatically-stressed Upper West Region of Ghana and charged with facilitating climate change responses at the local level and channelling community priorities into national climate change policy. A different kind of organization - the traditional chief council, the agricultural extension service, and a local NGO - was chosen by members to convene and coordinate the platform in each district. We examine platform members' accounts of the platform formation and selection of facilitating agent, their vision for platform roles, and their understandings of platform agenda and impacts. We analyse these narratives through the lens of institutional embeddedness, as expressed mostly, but not solely, by the choice of facilitating agents. We illustrate how the organizational position - and related vested interests - of facilitating agents contribute to shaping platform agendas, functions, and outcomes. This process hinges on the deployment of legitimacy claims, which may appeal to cultural tradition, technical expertise, community engagement, and dominant scientific narratives on climate change. 'institutional embeddedness is thereby shown to be a critical aspect of agency in multi-actor processes, contributing to framing local understandings of the climate change and to channelling collective efforts towards select response strategies. In conclusion, we stress that the institutional identity of facilitating agents and their relationship to members of the platform and to powerholders in the broader context provides a useful diagnostic lens to analyse the processes that shape the platform's ability to achieve its goals.

AB Green supply chain management (GSCM) practitioners striving to create a healthier environment should first identify the key criteria pertinent to the process of implementing the appropriate sustainable policies, particularly in the most rapidly growing electronics sector. Since the decision to adopt GSCM in electronics industry is associated with the use of a multi-dimensional approach involving a number of qualitative criteria, the paper examines GSCM based on fifteen criteria expressed in five dimensions and proposes a multi-criteria evaluation framework for selecting suitable green suppliers. In real life, the assessment of this decision is based on vague information or imprecise data of the expert's subjective judgements, including the feedback from the criteria and their interdependence. Thus to treat this uncertainty in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) process, rough number (RN) is applied here using only the internal knowledge in the operative data available to the decision-makers. In this way objective imprecisions and uncertainties are used and there is no need to rely on models of assumptions. Instead of different external parameters in the application of RN, the structure of the given data is used. Therefore, the identified components are incorporated into a rough DEMATEL-ANP (R'AMATEL) method, combining the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL) and the Analytical Network Process (ANP) in a rough context. In group decision making, a rough number-based approach aggregates individual judgements and handles imprecision. The structure of the relationships between the criteria expressed in different dimensions is determined by using the rough DEMATEL (R'DAMETEL) method and building an influential network relation mapping, based on which the rough ANP (R'ANP) method is implemented to obtain the respective criteria weights. Then, the rough multi-attribute Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis (R'MAIRCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance of suppliers for each evaluation criterion. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the impact of the weights of criteria and the influence of the decision maker's preferences on the final evaluation results. Applying the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and other ranking methods, the stability of the alternative rankings based on the variation in the criteria weights is checked. The results obtained in the study show that the proposed method significantly increases the objectivity of supplier assessment in a subjective environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Invasive tree pests are increasingly threatening forest ecosystems. Understanding and controlling their spread presents a major challenge for managers, researchers, and policy makers. In 1999, the pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, causal agent of pine wilt disease and native to North America, was first detected in Europe, more precisely in south-western Portugal. Since then, it has spread to more than 30% of the country, producing large-scale damages in Portuguese forests.
   2. We applied a new spatio-temporal network-based model to predict, at yearly intervals, the natural spread of the PWN on the Iberian Peninsula, as dispersed by the longhorn beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis, its only known vector in Europe. We compared the model predictions with independent observations of the natural spread of pine wilt disease in Portugal between 2005 and 2015. We simulated the effect of potential containment measures on the disease spread.
   3. The model predicted the status (infected or non-infected) of forest areas with 93% accuracy, had 93% sensitivity and specificity, and AUC=0.96 (averages for 8 years with validation data).
   4. Simulated clear-cut belts stopped the spread only if they were wider than 30 km, although thinner belts delayed invasion. Furthermore, clear-cuts were much more effective in slowing down the invasion when reinforced, in the adjacent areas, by the reduction in the vector beetle population through mass trapping and by the early detection and removal of infected trees.
   5. Model projections identified areas through which the nematode is most likely to invade, by natural means, the phytosanitary buffer zone established along the Portuguese border, and Spain.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In the absence of effective containment measures, the pine wood nematode may naturally spread into Spain in about 5 years. In less than 10 years, it may reach the major forest and climatic corridors that provide a gateway for subsequent expansion towards the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and, in the longer term, towards other European countries. Our model can considerably support management efforts by forecasting when areas are at highest risk of vector-mediated invasion as well as the effects of specific control measures on the disease spread.

AB Introduction: As South Korea remains technically at war with the North, higher smoking prevalence in the military might adversely affect the South Korea's military power and contribute to lifetime smoking in men with mandatory military service. This study was to identify priorities among the anti-smoking strategies to improve the existing smoking cessation programs for the Korean military. Methods: The analytic hierarchy process model with a goal, decision criteria, and sub-criteria as well as candidate strategies, was developed following a literature search and expert group discussion. A survey for pairwise comparison was conducted to determine the priority of the (sub-) criteria and strategies by 14 experts. The Super-Decisions software was used to determine the priorities and to analyze their consistency ratios and sensitivities. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare. Results: Eight candidate strategies were developed to improve the effectiveness of military anti-smoking interventions as follows: (1) development of outcome enhancement plans for smoking cessation programs for the military, (2) development of differentiated smoking cessation programs for specific groups, (3) building of community network for continuity and accessibility of anti-smoking project, (4) building of industry-academia-government networks for anti-smoking project, (5) improvement of the perception of and strengthen the reward for smoking cessation, (6) development of a training system for army clinicians for the delivery of smoking cessation services, (7) creation of a certification system for smoking cessation programs, and (8) development of an evaluation system of project performance for smoking cessation. Through the analytic hierarchy process survey, the military specificity and its sub-criterion of practicality were selected as the top concerns of decision criteria for the anti-smoking strategies among the decision criteria of outcome improvement, military specificity, publicness, and economic efficiency. The most important strategy was to improve the perception of and strengthen the reward for smoking cessation. This strategy was most focused on the creation of an anti-smoking environment and improvement of the effectiveness of the projects. The creation of a training system for army clinicians for the delivery of smoking cessation services ranked second. Conclusion: In conclusion, motivating smoking cessation and utilizing well-trained army clinicians were found to be the most important anti-smoking strategies for the Korean military. This study might provide valuable insights for policy makers to reduce tobacco use in the Korean military.

ID JUSTICE
AB The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature. When understood descriptively, it usefully supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and equality by advocating 'standing with' or aiding fellow community members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake, when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks, personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles. Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity, or indeed, any use of the term that posits an 'other' against which solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely, structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity needs to show how it is connected to justice.
   It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts, but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely. They advance the following definition: 'Solidarity is an enacted commitment to carry "costs" (financial, social, emotional, or otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature, it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states. Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a 'civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of that European model in their understanding (though their conception is supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity).
   Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing 'costs' with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term 'costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity, one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked by assistance for others who are perceived as 'different' from oneself, rather than as being 'similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect, inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of what is perceived as 'similar' and what counts as 'a relevant respect,' remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such as these and also explicate what counts as 'similar in a relevant respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental reciprocity or 'tit for tat' reciprocity.
   In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity. This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine. But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle. Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use. This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged. Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside these groups' borders.
   Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational relationships take a networked form and involve relations to 'outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is explicitly understood as 'weak solidarity,' namely, 'the willingness to take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the requirement 'to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic of 'strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and 'caring for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated with the motto of the three musketeers: 'One for all and all for one,' but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as involving a clear awareness of a 'we' or 'us'. Although some sense of a 'we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see.
   In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as 'similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing 'we' in the context of collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an instance of what I have elsewhere called 'common activities,' the norms go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed 'equal positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency, no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them. In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents requires a set of conditions, both material and social.
   Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals' fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely, but also can be said to constitute 'the other side of justice' (in Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals. The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further, the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics. Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it. These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but may also include networking to help alleviate suffering.
   As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged, we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals) undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then, we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The 'we' in the case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination, oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the 'we' should remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states.
   Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups, if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice. That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor. Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.) More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the existing housing stock.
   According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people as a result of structural processes in which many people participate.
   These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure, Young argues, turns our attention to 'how the institutions of a society work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which people stand give rise to what she calls a 'forward looking' sense of political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather, some have substantial control over the processes to which others are subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if the solidarity actions are to be effective.
   For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the impacts of the structural features of political economy and the injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor. In such cases, effective action must not only support workers individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that simply 'incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice, these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development and for participating in processes of collective self-determination. This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g., among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global, justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated within these movements themselves.
   I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective about these effects of the structural context in which they function, and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and various political and economic transformations are also needed. But solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system). Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice.
   There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice, rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the 'power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society, which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law. Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities. Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required. Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
   They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in various locales across the United States, including rural areas and those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been important for understanding and addressing the social and economic factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters, e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes. Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African Americans made up 80% of the people in flooded low-lying communities, sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than 1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where there were radically insufficient medical supplies available.
   In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75% of Haiti's healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian authorities, and over 90% of the aid money went to international actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid, too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017. This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti, we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts, but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S. government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects, establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would be necessary for the social transformative changes required.
   Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017. Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty. Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself, we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org, among many others. In the international context, mention should also be made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the 'White Helmets' operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case, since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis, Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the use of these databases.
   For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed, one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek, as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data. Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they would decide against contributing their own information, despite assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the very existence and continuation of these structural background conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice, if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these databases and they argue that only 'broad consent' is needed for the use of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal health data for use in medical databases.
   This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and their openness to corporate use of the included health information in the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social, technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks. This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use the qualification 'quasi' here to indicate that the input in question may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for formal rights of participation on governance boards by some representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of 'personalized medicine' or 'precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson.
   The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender, race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted. Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input. This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies, a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice.

INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation. More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for 'standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group with 'networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare, discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of solidarity in view.

AB This paper presents a set of freight generation (FG) models for seven cities in Kerala, India. Models were formulated by considering business size variables that capture establishment freight activity. Model estimation results revealed that business size indicators such as number of employees and gross floor area explained the freight generation well. Number of years in business (YB) was identified as another variable and considered in model specification to estimate FG. Detailed investigation of single variable FG models suggested that employment -based models are suitable for cities with dense commercial activities and higher land value, while area-based models better represented FG in cities with medium level of urbanization. Area appears to be a skewed indicator for representing business size in cities with dense commercial activities. In this case, where acquiring area is difficult, employment may be a better representative of growth in freight activity. As an extension of city specific FG models, three types of combined FG models were developed to provide quantitative statistical evidence for differences in model specifications across the cities. The statistical findings from these models suggest that freight activities are influenced by the interaction of establishment characteristics and its location. Interaction effect is more prominent when area is used to represent the business size. Since a systematic commodity flow survey practice is absent in India, planners and policy makers can be benefited from this study while making decisions on freight specific investment schemes and freight operation strategies. The interaction FG models discussed subsequently in this study may be utilized in transportation planning application for the state, regional and corridor level network capacity needs.

AB Healthcare is a highly institutionalized industry, subject to multiple regulatory forces, high levels of professionalism, and growing network externalities which may affect the decisions to adopt. Hence, this research integrates the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), institutional theory along with Human Organization Technology (HOT) fit model as the organization theories to explain the adoption of Hospital Information System (HIS). To examine the effects of inter and intra-organizational potential factors on HIS adoption, within the context of Malaysian public hospitals, a survey method using web-based questionnaire is employed. The role of hospital size in this study is investigated to determine its distinct moderating influence among the relationships of the HIS adoption and significant dimensional factors. The results indicated that system affiliation (p < 0.05), mimetic pressure-competitors (p < 0.1), normative pressure (p < 0.05), and employees' IS knowledge (p < 0.05) were the most significant drivers for adopting HIS in the public hospitals of Malaysia. The results also showed that hospital size as the only moderator of this study has no significant effect on the other relationships in our developed theoretical model. In other words, the effects of the significant factors on HIS adoption are the same in three small, medium, and large Malaysian public hospitals. This research presents a conceptual foundation for future researches and fills a gap in the literature regarding the inter-organizational factors influencing the adoption of HIS.

AB Context Restoring or establishing corridors between residual forest patches is one of the most adopted strategies for the conservation of animal populations and ecosystem processes in fragmented landscapes.
   Objectives This study aimed to assess whether it is more effective to focus restoration actions on existing corridors or to establish habitats in other strategic areas that can create new dispersal pathways to enhance connectivity.
   Methods We considered a real agroecosystem in northern Italy, based our analyses on graph-theory and habitat availability metrics, and focused on the Hazel Dormouse as the target species. We compared the connectivity increase resulting from (i) the simulated restoration of existing priority corridors, i.e., those with significant presence of forest but in which restoration actions would still result in considerable connectivity gains, or (ii) the simulated plantation of 30 hedgerows along new priority pathways, i.e., those areas with no current forest cover in which habitat creation would be more beneficial for connectivity.
   Results Implementing new priority pathways resulted in substantially larger connectivity gains (+38%) than when restoration efforts were concentrated in improving already existing corridors (+11%).
   Conclusions Establishing hedgerows along new pathways allowed enhancing the complementary and functionality of the full set of landscape corridors and proved more efficient than just strengthening the areas where dispersal flows were already concentrated. We demonstrated the importance of analytical procedures able to compare the effectiveness of different management strategies for enhancing connectivity. Our approach may be applied to multiple species sensitive to fragmentation in other heterogeneous landscapes and geographical contexts.

AB The article illuminates the dynamics of bilateral cross-border cooperation between two vastly different legal-administrative partners. The analysis utilizes empirical findings of a case study on bilateral Finnish-Russian crime prevention cooperation. Currently, both the differences in national legislations and the fast-changing administrative environment make this cooperation challenging. The case study showed that bilateral cooperation, which is the dominant form of cooperation between EU member states and Russia, is currently affected by disjointed and even competing multilateral and bilateral structures, differences in criminal law and procedure, gaps between international treaties and national legislation, local and regional variations of practices, weak institutional trust and abrupt policy changes. The results indicate that the effectiveness of cross-border networks cannot be assessed strictly in terms of quantitative outcomes. Further long-term development of the cooperation requires both realistic understanding of legal-administrative constraints and strong commitment at the national and supranational political levels.
   Points for practitioners Future long-term development of cross-border crime prevention cooperation between EU member countries and the Russian Federation requires more flexible crime prevention instruments and institutionalization of joint investigation teams. The optimal model in joint criminal investigations with Russian authorities could be one where the evidence of the protocol of the preliminary investigation could be acquired through direct regional connections between authorities. In practice, this requires a much stronger practical trust between different levels of authorities in the EU member countries and the Russian Federation, reconciliation of differences in national legislations and long-term political commitment at the highest level.

AB Mode shift from public transport (PT) to private car when a PT shut-down occurs results in an increase in the number of car trips on the road network which may contribute to traffic congestion. Policies aimed at reducing the mode shift to car can be designed through a better understanding of PT users' mode shift in the event of a PT disruption. Furthermore, the share of car mode shift is also an important parameter for assessing traffic congestion relief associated with day to day PT provision in cities. This study sought to uncover factors influencing the mode shift to car among PT users in the event of a PT disruption. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 30PT users from Melbourne, Australia. Grounded theory was used to derive categories and subcategories of behavioural responses. Factors affecting mode shift to car if PT ceases in the short term were classified into three main themes with several subcategories: individual-specific factors, context specific factors and journey-specific factors. In the long term, the analysis reveals that only context-specific factors have an influence on mode shift. Findings show that car access, travel time, travel cost, trip importance, non-central business district (CBD) trips, weather, flexibility and accessibility to PT stations are the most important factors favouring use of the car if PT ceases in the short term. This acts to increase traffic congestion due to the mode shift to car. However, in the long term, removing PT is expected to have an impact on land use, leading to individuals changing their residential and workplace location. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parks provide critical ecosystem services to urban residents. Park access critically determines how parks are used by residents. Many existing studies, which mostly have been conducted in developed countries, reported that park access disproportionately benefits the socioeconomically advantaged groups. To test if this observation also holds true in developing countries, we examined the park access and its relationship with socioeconomic conditions in Beijing, China. We used a buffering method and a road network-based analysis to calculate the park access of 130 neighborhoods, and applied the Pearson correlation to examine how neighborhood park access is related to socioeconomic conditions. Our results showed that (1) the park access decreased from 76% in the downtown areas to 24% in the suburbs; (2) the correlation coefficients (r) between socioeconomic conditions and park access were all smaller than 0.3 (p < 0.05)-that is, explaining less than 8% of the variability. Our study indicated that neighborhood socioeconomic conditions were only weakly associated with park access in Beijing and did not support the common phenomenon in western countries. Such a contradiction might be explained by the fact that park planning in Beijing is funded and administered by the city government and influenced by the central government's policy, whereas in most developed countries market sectors play a critical role in park planning. Our research suggested that urban planning funded by governments, when aimed at improving the wellbeing of all urban residents, may effectively reduce potential environmental inequalities.

AB Modern, affordable pathology and laboratory medicine (PALM) systems are essential to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals for health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this last in a Series of three papers about PALM in LMICs, we discuss the policy environment and emphasise three crucial high-level actions that are needed to deliver universal health coverage. First, nations need national strategic laboratory plans; second, these plans require adequate financing for implementation; and last, pathologists themselves need to take on leadership roles to advocate for the centrality of PALM to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for health. The national strategic laboratory plan should deliver a tiered, networked laboratory system as a central element. Appropriate financing should be provided, at a level of at least 4% of health expenditure. Financing of new technologies such as molecular diagnostics is challenging for LMICs, even though many of these tests are cost-effective. Point-of-care testing can substantially reduce test-reporting time, but this benefit must be balanced with higher costs. Our research analysis highlights a considerable deficiency in advocacy for PALM; pathologists have been invisible in national and international health discourse and leadership. Embedding PALM in LMICs can only be achieved if pathologists advocate for these services, and undertake leadership roles, both nationally and internationally. We articulate eight key recommendations to address the current barriers identified in this Series and issue a call to action for all stakeholders to come together in a global alliance to ensure the effective provision of PALM services in resource-limited settings.

AB Every city seeks opportunities to spur economic developments and, depending on its type, vacant land can be seen as a potential threat or an opportunity to achieve these developments. Although vacant land exists in all cities, the causes and effects of changes in vacant land can differ. Growing cities may have more vacant land than shrinking cities because of large scale annexation. Meanwhile, depopulation and economic downturn may increase the total amount of vacant and abandoned properties. Despite various causes of increase and decrease of vacant land, the ability to predict future vacancy patterns-where future vacant parcels may occur-could be a critical test to set up appropriate development strategies and land use policies, especially in shrinking cities, to manage urban decline and regeneration efforts more wisely. This study compares current and future vacancy patterns of a growing city (Fort Worth, TX, USA) and a shrinking city (Chicago, IL, USA), by employing the Land Transformation Model (LTM) to predict for future vacant lands. This research predicts and produces possible vacancy pattern scenarios by 2020 and deciphers the ranking of determinants of vacant land in each city type. The outcomes of this study indicate that the LTM can be useful for simulating vacancy patterns and the causes of vacancy vary in both growing and shrinking cities. Socio-economic factors such as unemployment rate and household income are powerful determinants of vacancy in a growing city, while physical and transportation-related conditions such as proximity to highways, vehicle accessibility, or building conditions show a stronger influence on increasing vacant land in a shrinking city.

AB Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is considered to be a powerful model intended to achieve sustainable urban development. A well-designed TOD enhances the accessibility of different kinds of activities, reduces transportation costs and improves the comfort and safety of travel for the neighbourhood as whole, thereby increasing the willingness to pay for real estate properties located nearby. This study examines the housing price premiums of bus transit-oriented development (BTOD), a particular type of TOD that has become quite common in practice, especially in cities where public transportation is provided primarily through a bus system instead of a metro or light rail system. BTOD projects are built at major nodes of a bus network and typically include housing units and commercial services. Our research focuses on four completed BTODs in the Seattle metropolitan area, and employs data on sales prices, physical attributes, neighbourhood characteristics and location features for almost 7000 single-family homes located within a 1.5-mile radius. Using Hedonic price analysis, we find that these BTODs have generated significant positive effects on the values of adjacent homes, especially those located within 0.5 miles. Results from a more sophisticated longitudinal analysis using the data for Renton, one of the BTODs, confirm the price premiums while gaining additional insights about the temporal variations. These findings have an important policy implication, which is especially relevant for cities with an extensive bus transit system: local governments can generate additional tax revenues while advancing sustainability through bus transit-oriented developments.

AB In developing countries, recyclable material collectors cooperatives are presented as a public policy model for managing urban solid wastes with recyclable potential (MSWRP). They are a fundamental part of the resources recovery chain. Thus, this study proposes a method to help analyse the management performance of cooperatives in their operational activities in the recycling chain (OARC): in waste collection management, in production management, in waste marketing management, and as an instrument of social inclusion, income generation and MSWRP reduction. To exemplify the application of the method, longitudinal research was carried out on some characteristics of cooperatives based in a medium-sized city in Brazil. For data treatment, the DEA-SBM models, Tobit regression and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used. The results indicated that cooperatives are heterogeneous, with different levels of management performance and administrative organisation. This presents communication difficulties and creates disparities in the rent paid by the collection centres for the collection trucks. In some cases, cooperatives are organised with separate administrative sectors, while in others all administrative functions are performed by the president. The results also indicated the need for maintenance and an increase in public actions to integrate the cooperatives and waste collectors with the aim to guarantee greater control in the collection, production and commercialisation of MSWRP. This is important as improvements in cooperatives' management performances in their OARC are fundamental to their survival and the improvement of their members' quality of life.

AB From the early days of the printed press, citizens have challenged and modified the information environment as constructed by governments and media organizations. In the digital era, this struggle is manifested in the work of civil-society organizations calling to expand the boundaries of digital rights such as access to the internet, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy. Alongside their traditional activity of confronting governments and internet organizations, these bodies have also engaged in educating citizens about their rights. In order to shed light on such educational efforts, I examine the activities of four civil-society organizations operating in three countries (Germany, Israel, and the U.S.) by conducting a content analysis of their websites between 2013 and 2015. The results suggest that the organizations' interactions with the public are guided by three main principles: (1) cultural informational framing: delivering accurate technological and political information, which is framed so as to resonate with the cultural premises and everyday lives of the target audiences; (2) personal activism: propelling citizens toward participation, primarily through political clicktivism and by providing them with technological guidance and tools for digital self-protection; and (3) branding digital rights activism: fostering a unique image for a particular organization's digital rights activism, mostly through selling merchandise to citizens. Using these strategies, the organizations aim to construct the social-political-cultural identity of a generation who are knowledgeable, politically active, and aware of their rights in the digital age. The characteristics of this identity are discussed in the conclusion.

AB In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in research literature on the challenges of interconnected, compound, interacting, and cascading risks. These concepts are becoming ever more central to the resilience debate. They aggregate elements of climate change adaptation, critical infrastructure protection, and societal resilience in the face of complex, high-impact events. However, despite the potential of these concepts to link together diverse disciplines, scholars and practitioners need to avoid treating them in a superficial or ambiguous manner. Overlapping uses and definitions could generate confusion and lead to the duplication of research effort. This article gives an overview of the state of the art regarding compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks. It is intended to help build a coherent basis for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR). The main objective is to propose a holistic framework that highlights the complementarities of the four kinds of complex risk in a manner that is designed to support the work of researchers and policymakers. This article suggests how compound, interconnected, interacting, and cascading risks could be used, with little or no redundancy, as inputs to new analyses and decisional tools designed to support the implementation of the SFDRR. The findings can be used to improve policy recommendations and support tools for emergency and crisis management, such as scenario building and impact trees, thus contributing to the achievement of a system-wide approach to resilience.

AB The ALLIANCE(6) Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) initiated by the STAR7 Network of Excellence and integrated in the research strategy implemented by the COMET consortium, defines a long-term vision of the needs for, and implementation of, research in radioecology. This reference document, reflecting views from many stakeholders groups and researchers, serves as an input to those responsible for defining EU research call topics through the ALLIANCE SRA statement delivered each year to the EJP-CONCERT8 (2015-2020). This statement highlights a focused number of priorities for funding. Research in radioecology and related sciences is justified by various drivers, such as policy changes, scientific advances and knowledge gaps, radiological risk perception by the public, and a growing awareness of interconnections between human and ecosystem health. The SRA is being complemented by topical roadmaps that have been initiated by the COMET9 ECfunded project, with the help and endorsement of the ALLIANCE. The strategy underlying roadmap development is driven by the need for improved mechanistic understanding across radioecology. By meeting this need, we can provide fit-for-purpose human and environmental impact/risk assessments in support of the protection of man and the environment in interaction with society and for the three exposure situations defined by the ICRP (i.e., planned, existing and emergency). Within the framework of the EJP-CONCERT the development of a joint roadmap is under discussion among all the European research platforms and will highlight the major research needs for the whole radiation protection field and how these are likely to be addressed by 2030.

AB Owing to the vast territory of China and strong regional characteristic of ozone pollution, it's desirable for policy makers to have a targeted and prioritized regulation and ozone pollution control strategy in China based on scientific evidences. It's important to assess its current pollution status as well as spatial and temporal variation patterns across China. Recent advances of national monitoring networks provide an opportunity to insight the actions of ozone pollution. Here, we present rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis that was used on studying the spatiotemporal characteristics of daily ozone concentrations. Based on results of REOF analysis in pollution seasons for 3 years' observations, twelve regions with clear patterns were identified in China. The patterns of temporal variation of ozone in each region were separated well and different from each other, reflecting local meteorological, photochemical or pollution features. A rising trend in annual averaged Eight-hour Average Ozone Concentrations (O-3-8 hr) from 2014 to 2016 was observed for all regions, except for the Tibetan Plateau. The mean values of annual and 90 percentile concentrations for all 338 cities were 82.6 +/- 14.6 and 133.9 +/- 25.8 mu g/m(3), respectively, in 2015. The regionalization results of ozone were found to be influenced greatly by terrain features, indicating significant terrain and landform effects on ozone spatial correlations. Among 12 regions, North China Plain, Huanghuai Plain, Central Yangtze River Plain, Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin were realized as priority regions for mitigation strategies, due to their higher ozone concentrations and dense population.

AB Background: Overdose is a major cause of death among injecting drug users in Wales. Few studies, however, have explored the overdose responses of witnesses in this context. This study applies Rhodes' concept of the 'risk environment' to examine how witnesses respond to opiate overdose.
   Method: In depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifty-five participants recruited from statutory and third sector drug treatment providers operating across South Wales and from two Welsh prisons. Eligibility was based on whether the person was, or had recently been, an opiate user and whether they had personally experienced or witnessed an overdose event.
   Results: Witnesses were amenable to assisting overdosed peers. However, a number of micro- and macro-level factors impeded the successful implementation of harm reduction techniques in response to an overdose. At micro level, the social setting of injecting drug use, peer group drug use norms and difficulties in identifying an overdose were linked to ineffective response. Macro-level factors including laws governing the possession of drugs and harm reduction discourse were also found to limit the uptake of overdose response techniques.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest a need to insert pragmatic solutions into overdose prevention programmes and training to counter the factors hindering effective responses to overdose. This includes simpler techniques and harnessing the support and knowledge of injecting drug users' social networks. Although these will go some way to addressing specific micro-level barriers, we also emphasise the need for additional policy measures that can address the macro-environmental conditions that produce and maintain features of injecting drug users' risk environments.

AB This article underlines the relevance of anthropometric history among the disciplines concerned with health and nutrition. The examination of changes on the nutritional status and inequality in Spain focused the 4th Anthropometric History Workshop held at the beginning of 2018 where 18 original contributions were presented and discussed.
   We first show the ability of human stature to approach the impact of socioeconomic processes and environmental changes on the nutritional status over the last centuries. Then it is proceeded to present the main contents and advances achieved in the workshop. The papers coped with diverse dimensions of inequality regarding nutritional health and its determinants since the end of the 18th century until 2015. Aside of height and weight at different ages, principally adult ones, others anthropometric indicators were analyzed such as sexual dimorphism and low weight at birth. The results illustrate the large prevalence of malnutrition and social inequality in past Spain. These problems persisted over a good part of the 20th century (i.e. stunting) and, they acquired a different nature since the 1980s as the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity reveals. It is concluded that the determinants of nutritional status and health-related inequalities request multidimensional approaches and the dialogue between social sciences and biomedical sciences. Knowing about their dimensions in the past and their evolution over time provides a valuable basis in order to understand current problems in these areas and to address future public policies more adequately on childhood and adolescence.

TI Home away from home: Health and wellbeing benefits of men's sheds
SO HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English

DE community based intervention; healthy environments; men's health
ID MOVEMENT
AB Issue addressed: Improving the health of men is a national policy priority. The Men's Shed program is one health promoting initiative that seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of men. This study assessed Men's Shed members' perceptions of the health and wellbeing benefits of Men's Shed activity in a large regional Queensland Men's Shed.
   Methods: Data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire from 147 and three group interviews with 17 shedders. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine differences in shedders perceived health and wellbeing measures retrospectively just before joining the Men's Shed and currently. Thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data.
   Results: There was no change in overall self-assessed health of shedders before and after joining the Men's Shed. Shedders expanded their social networks, and experienced less felt need for social interaction. Shedders' level of satisfaction with feeling part of the community and life as a whole increased. Health and wellbeing benefits of Men's Shed included fellowship, sense of belonging, access to equipment, and learning new and sharing their own skills.
   Conclusions: The Men's Shed appeared to provide social health and wellbeing benefits to its members, and an environment for quality social interaction. The Men's Shed is seen as a place for and about members - men.
   So what? Men's Shed may have a unique role in supporting the social health and wellbeing of men beyond that already available from other community groups by providing an environment for the fellowship of men and activities of interest in an unstructured way.

AB The limited supply of fossil fuels and the establishment of new environmental policies shifted research in industry and academia toward sustainable production of the second generation of biofuels, with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) being one promising fuel candidate. MEK is a commercially valuable petrochemical with an extensive application as a solvent. However, as of today, a sustainable and economically viable production of MEK has not yet been achieved despite several attempts of introducing biosynthetic pathways in industrial microorganisms. We used BNICE.ch as a retrobiosynthesis tool to discover all novel pathways around MEK. Out of 1325 identified compounds connecting to MEK with one reaction step, we selected 3-oxopentanoate, but-3-en-2-one, but-1-en-2-olate, butylamine, and 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile for further study. We reconstructed 3 679 610 novel biosynthetic pathways toward these 5 compounds. We then embedded these pathways into the genome-scale model of E. coli, and a set of 18 622 were found to be the most biologically feasible ones on the basis of thermodynamics and their yields. For each novel reaction in the viable pathways, we proposed the most similar KEGG reactions, with their gene and protein sequences, as candidates for either a direct experimental implementation or as a basis for enzyme engineering. Through pathway similarity analysis we classified the pathways and identified the enzymes and precursors that were indispensable for the production of the target molecules. These retrobiosynthesis studies demonstrate the potential of BNICE.ch for discovery, systematic evaluation, and analysis of novel pathways in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering studies.

AB AimsMethodsThe Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium was established by the National Institutes of Health in 2015 to expand research beyond the detection and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) to the promotion and preservation of bladder health and prevention of LUTS in girls and women. While many multi-disciplinary scientific networks focus on pelvic floor dysfunction and LUTS, the PLUS Consortium stands alone in its focus on prevention. This article describes the PLUS approach to developing a conceptual framework to guide the Consortium's initial prevention research agenda.
   The conceptual framework was informed by traditional social ecological models of public health, biopsychosocial models of health, Glass and McAtee's Society-Behavior-Biology Nexus, and the World Health Organization's conceptual framework for action on the social determinants of health.
   ResultsConclusionsThe PLUS conceptual framework provides a foundation for developing prevention interventions that have the greatest likelihood of promoting and preserving bladder health among diverse populations.
   PLUS Consortium work is premised on the notion that programs, practices, and policies designed to promote health will have optimal impact if the conceptual foundation upon which efforts are based is comprehensive and informed by multiple disciplines. The PLUS conceptual framework is broadly applicable to domains of health that have historically focused on the treatment of illness and symptoms rather than the promotion of health. It is also applicable to domains of health that have been examined from a predominantly biological or social ecological perspective, without integration of both perspectives.

AB Purpose - This study aims to evaluate the link between climate/weather change and farmer migration in Bihar, India. The influence of cognitive conditions and climate-related stress on farmer migration decisions and the socioeconomic characteristics of migrating and non-migrating farm households are analysed. The focus is the role of migration in access to climate and agricultural extension services and the contribution of migration to enhanced farmer coping capacity.
   Design/methodology/approach - A primary survey was conducted of farm households in seven districts of Bihar, India. Farmer perceptions of climate change were analysed using the mental map technique. The role of socioeconomic characteristics in farm household migration was evaluated using binary logistic regression, and the influence of migration on access to climate and agricultural extension services and the adaptive capacity of migrating households was investigated using descriptive statistics.
   Findings - Climate-induced livelihood risk factors are one of the major drivers of farmer's migration. The farmers' perception on climate change influences migration along with the socioeconomic characteristics. There is a significant difference between migrating and non-migrating farm households in the utilization of instructions, knowledge and technology based climate and agriculture extension services. Benefits from receipt of remittance, knowledge and social networks from the host region enhances migrating households' adaptive capacity.
   Originality/value - This study provides micro-evidence of the contribution of migration to farmer adaptive capacity and access to climate and agricultural extension services, which will benefit analyses of climate-induced migration in other developing countries with higher agricultural dependence. In addition, valuable insights are delivered on policy requirements to reduce farmer vulnerability to climate change.

AB An increase in fracture risk has been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with canagliflozin, possibly mediated by effects induced by all members of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class. It is unclear whether initiation of dapagliflozin is followed by an increase in the risk of fracture; therefore, we performed a population-based, open cohort study (from January 2013 to January 2016) using The Health Improvement Network (THIN). A total of 22 618 people with T2DM (4548 exposed to dapagliflozin and 18 070 receiving standard antidiabetic treatment, matched for age, sex, body mass index and diabetes duration) with no history of fractures at baseline were included. The primary outcome was the occurrence of any fragility fracture (hip, spine, wrist) during the observation period. Risk of any fracture served as a secondary outcome. Adjusted hazard rate ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox regression. A total of 289 fractures (132 fragility fractures) were recorded. No difference in the risk of fragility fracture was detected between participants prescribed dapagliflozin and matched control participants (crude HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59-1.39, P = .645; adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56-1.35, P = .531). Similarly, no difference in the risk of any fracture was detected (adjusted HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66-1.20; P = .427). Sensitivity analyses limited to the subset of the population at high risk of fracture produced similar results; thus, there was no evidence to suggest an increase in the risk of treatment-emergent fractures in patients with T2DM who initiated treatment with dapagliflozin.

TI Strengthening the Quality and Quantity of the Nursing and Midwifery
   Workforce: Report on Eight Years of the NEPI Project
SO ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB In response to the urgent need to scale up access to antiretroviral therapy, the Global Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (GNCBP), a PEPFAR program administered by the U.S. Department of Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), was implemented from 2011 to 2018 by ICAP at Columbia University. Working closely together, HRSA and ICAP partnered with local nursing leaders and ministries of health to strengthen the nursing and midwifery workforce across 11 countries. This multi-country project, developed to address critical gaps in nursing education and training worked across six building blocks of health workforce strengthening: infrastructure improvement, curricula revision, clinical skills development, in-service training, faculty development and building partnerships for policy and regulation to increase the quality and quantity of the nursing and midwifery workforce. As a result, 13,387 nursing and midwifery students graduated from schools supported under GNCBP. A total of 5,554 nurses received critical in-service training and 4,886 faculty, clinical mentors and preceptors received training in key clinical care areas and modern teaching methodologies. ICAP completed 43 infrastructure enhancements to ensure environments conducive to learning and strengthened nursing leaders as best evidenced by the election and formation of Mozambique's first national nursing council and the NEPI Network. Going forward, efforts to strengthen nursing and midwifery can build on the results of the GNCBP project. Going forward, a new group of African nursing leaders are being supported to advocate for high quality patientcare led through inter-professional collaboration and participation in international efforts championing the critical role of nurses in achieving universal health coverage.

AB The Municipality of Naples, with about 1 million residents and about 3 million people living in the surroundings, suffers, as for many a city, from low air quality, as demonstrated by the concentration level of pollutants measured by fixed monitoring stations of the Regional Air Quality Network. The port of Naples is among the most important ports in the Mediterranean sea with a large traffic of passengers and goods. Therefore, it contributes to atmospheric pollution of the nearby urban area with ship emissions. Public authorities need to know the contribution of different sources of atmospheric pollutants to put effective environmental policies into practice. In this article, a bottom-up methodology has been developed to assess the amount of atmospheric pollutants emitted by cruise ships traffic and its impact on the atmospheric pollution in Naples. A detailed description of in-port activities of cruise ships has been applied to calculate emission rates of NO and SO. by using standard procedures corrected and integrated by real data to better evaluate actual engine power applied and fuel consumption. Considered activities include: navigation in port both at arrival and departure; maneuvering for berthing and unmooring and hoteling at berth. The study covers all cruise ship calls during the year 2016. The impact of cruise ship emissions on the urban area has been assessed by using the Gaussian puff model CALPUFF, thus obtaining contour maps of 1-h and year average values. Finally, in order to assess the contribution of cruise ship emissions to air quality, simulations have been compared with concentrations measured at fixed monitoring stations and during a monitoring campaign.

AB Long-term field-based monitoring is time and resource demanding. Consequently, there are few robust biodiversity databases that contain both a baseline and repeat measurements. On-line repositories represent a potential goldmine of conservation-relevant data, and are increasingly incentivized by funding agencies. However, there remains scarce information on their distribution and availability, limiting the possibility to exploit them to their full potential. Here we comprehensively searched and assessed open-access datasets where biodiversity has been monitored in the same site for at least 4 years, and where species and site locations were clearly reported. We located data on 75,669 field sites (9436 of which are in biodiversity hotspots), for a total of 28,723,226 records, monitoring a total of 15,046 different taxa. We found strong geographic and taxonomic biases. Monitoring sites were predominantly located in the Palearctic and Nearctic biogeographic realms and in the forest biome. Where fauna was monitored, the focus was mostly on amphibians and birds. Supporting open-access policies and developing strategies to fill the identified gaps will be crucial for improving our understanding of global biodiversity trends. Our results suggest, however, that we are on the right trajectory, with a vast storehouse of readily available (and often high quality) yet largely under-analysed biodiversity data now available online from a range of sources. We argue that such data can provide the required biodiversity baselines for national- or local-scale studies.

AB Poverty has been a focus of Chinese government for a long time. It is therefore of great significance to investigate both the mechanisms and spatial patterns of regional impoverishment in order to adequately target Chinese anti-poverty goals. Based on the human-environment relationship and multidimensional poverty theory, this study initially develops a three-dimensional model encompassing human, society, and environmental factors to investigate the mechanisms of rural impoverishment as well as to construct an indicator system to evaluate the comprehensive poverty level (CPL) in rural areas. A back propagation neural network model was then applied to measure CPL, and standard deviation classification was used to identify counties that still require national policy-support (CRNPSs) subsequent to 2020. The results of this study suggest that CPL values conform to a decreasing trend from the southeast coast towards the inland northwest of China. Data also show that 716 CRNPSs will be present after 2020, mainly distributed in high-arid areas of the Tibetan Plateau, the transitional zones of the three-gradient terrain, as well as karst areas of southwest China. Furthermore, CRNPSs can be divided into four types, that is, key aiding counties restricted by multidimensional factors, aiding counties restricted by human development ability, aiding counties restricted by both natural resource endowment and socioeconomic development level, and aiding counties restricted by both human development ability and socioeconomic development level. We therefore propose that China should develop and adopt scientific and targeted strategies to relieve the relative poverty that still exist subsequent to 2020.

   MITIGATION; SELECTION; SYSTEM; DISRUPTIONS; DEMATEL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify various risk and sub-risk drivers that affect the supply chain (SC) performance and to propose a framework to quantify the overall SC risk index by considering the importance of each risk and sub-risk drivers and their mutual interactions.
   Design/methodology/approach A hybrid method based on decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and analytical network process has been proposed to develop the risk quantification framework. A case study of Indian petroleum supply chain (PSC) has been illustrated to explain the proposed method.
   Findings The results of this study found that transportation/logistics (delivery system), quality of the petroleum products, crude supply, customer's order and legal/political regulations are the most significant risk drivers of a typical PSC. It is also found that the Indian PSC possesses a risk score of 34 percent.
   Research limitations/implications The quantification of risk in operational measure provides an unblemished representation of the overall SC risk. Unlike the existing financial measure, it takes complex subjective operational effectiveness like product quality, customer satisfaction, etc., into consideration. Identifying the high-prioritized risks helps the decision and policy makers to merely focus on the most prominent risk drivers, and reduce the impact of overall SC risk. Planning a risk mitigation strategy at a given level of risk is however beyond the scope of this research.
   Originality/value The paper develops a risk quantification framework in the context of a PSC.

AB Crop modelling has the potential to contribute to global food and nutrition security. This paper briefly examines the history of crop modelling by international crop research centres of the CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research but now known simply as CGIAR), whose primary focus is on less developed countries. Basic principles of crop modelling building up to a Genotype x Environment x Management x Socioeconomic (G x E x M x S) paradigm, are explained. Modelling has contributed to better understanding of crop performance and yield gaps, better prediction of pest and insect outbreaks, and improving the efficiency of crop management including irrigation systems and optimization of planting dates. New developments include, for example, use of remote sensed data and mobile phone technology linked to crop management decision support models, data sharing in the new era of big data, and the use of genomic selection and crop simulation models linked to environmental data to help make crop breeding decisions. Socio-economic applications include foresight analysis of agricultural systems under global change scenarios, and the consequences of potential food system shocks are also described. These approaches are discussed in this paper which also calls for closer collaboration among disciplines in order to better serve the crop research and development communities by providing model based recommendations ranging from policy development at the level of governmental agencies to direct crop management support for resource poor farmers.

AB Background: Potential users' preferences for telemedicine services directed to cardio-vascular diseases are investigated applying a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Given the potential of telemedicine to minimize costs without reducing overall efficiency, assessing preferences for these types of services represents a priority for policy makers. This is especially true for those pathologies that absorb a relatively high quota of total health expenditure. The empirical setting is Sardinia (Italy) because of its insularity and the underdeveloped internal transport network. Telemedicine is likely to mitigate distance between healthcare providers and final users.
   Methods: A survey conducted between February and May 2013 was administered to a selected Sardinian population older than 18 (potential users) through face-to-face interviews. A discrete choice experiment was implemented and four attributes (i.e. scanning mode, location, waiting list and cost) assess in what measure these influence potential users' utility by using a random parameter modelling with heterogeneity (RPH).
   Results: The empirical findings, based on 2000 interviews, highlight that potential users are not very open to the application of telemedicine services in cardiology, mostly preferring the intromoenia (visit at the hospital) and private system. Besides, remarkable individual heterogeneity has been found.
   Conclusions: Potential users see the implementation of new technologies in healthcare with a certain caution. However, the relatively higher preferences towards services provided at their own municipality suggests that there is ground to explore further the implementation of telemedicine services through the family doctor and local pharmacy.

AB Climate change has largely affected natural ecosystems around the world, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Rangelands have great significance in carbon cycle due to their contribution for a large part of regional net primary production (NPP). These ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change. Given the Isfahan Province, central Iran, as the study area, an attempt is made to simulate changes in the rangeland aboveground net primary production (ANPP) under three RCP (representative concentration pathways) climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for two periods (2050s and 2070s). The rangeland ANPP was estimated using a support vector machine (SVM) model with RMSE of 23.78g C m(-2) year(-1) and R-2 of 0.92. Changes in the mean annual precipitation and temperature due to climate change were projected by ensembling 14 General Circulation Models (GCMs) through a weighting approach. The results indicated trends towards drier and warmer conditions in future periods. The maximum decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature are projected to occur in western and eastern parts of the province, respectively. The mean annual ANPP showed different trends between bioclimatic zones. It decreased about 25.9% in the sub-humid and cold zone and increased over 120% in the hyper-arid and warm zone by 2070s. Generally, rangelands in western and southwestern parts of the province are found to be more vulnerable to future drying-warming condition. These results highlight the need of adopting proper policies to encounter various effects of climate change in this region.

AB This study's focus is on Palapye, a predominantly dryland agricultural but urbanising region in eastern Botswana. Maps of ten land use-land cover (LULC) categories at three time points (1986, 2000, and 2014) were produced based on the ISO 19144 land cover classification scheme. Land change intensities were examined at the time interval, category and transition levels using Intensity Analysis. A combination of multi-layer perceptron neural network and Markov chain analysis was used to project LULC to 2028 and investigate future changes. The rate of land change was faster during the second time interval (2000-2014) than during the first time interval (1986-2000) as the region transforms from an agrarian to a service economy. In the first time interval cropland was a net losing category, whereas it was a net gaining category during the second time interval. Cropland expanded into shrublands in the southwestern part of the study area. The built-up category was active in gains during the two time intervals as it targeted grasslands and shrublands. Built-up is also projected to gain an additional 272 km(2) by 2028. The bareland and paved/rocky materials categories were also active in gains during both time intervals. A loss of 26% of natural land cover over the study period was recorded due mainly to transition into croplands, built-up areas, and grassland. The policy implications of findings are discussed as this region is important for biodiversity, ecosystem services, food production, mining, and tourism.

AB For better or worse, in those parts of the world with a widespread farming, livestock rising, and urban expansion, the maintenance of species richness and ecosystem services cannot depend only upon protected natural sites. Can they rely on a network of cultural landscapes endowed with their own associated biodiversity? We analyze the effects of land-cover change on landscape ecological patterns and processes that sustain bird species richness associated to cropland-grassland landscapes in the Great Plains-Denver metropolitan edge. Our purpose is to assess the potential contribution to bird biodiversity maintenance of Great Plain's cropland-grassland mosaics kept as farmland green belts in the edge of metropolitan areas. We present a quantitative landscape ecology assessment of land-cover changes (1930-2010) experienced in five Great Plains counties in Colorado. Several landscape metrics assess the diversity of land-cover patterns and their impact on ecological connectivity indices. These metrics are applied to historical land-cover maps and datasets drawn from aerial photos and satellite imagery. The results show that the cropland-grassland mosaics that link the metropolitan edge with the surrounding habitats sheltered in less human-disturbed areas provide a heterogeneous land matrix were a high bird species richness exists. They also suggest that keeping multifunctional farmland-grassland green belts near the edge of metropolitan areas may provide important ecosystem services, supplementing traditional conservation policies. Our maps and indicators can be used for selecting certain types of landscape patterns and priority areas on which biodiversity conservation efforts and land-use planning can concentrate.

AB Despite their recognized agricultural sustainability benefits, mixed crop-livestock farms have declined in the Northern hemisphere. As such, crop-livestock integration beyond the farm level is a promising alternative to this trend, but the knowledge of critical factors and strategies towards its successful implementation is still lacking. We developed an analytical framework to assess the critical determinants of the emergence and outcomes of integration, which helped us understand farmers' collective strategies for reducing integration transaction costs. The resulting framework distinguishes between three types of transaction costs: information gathering, collective decision-making, and operational and monitoring costs. These costs are influenced by several factors: external environment attributes, resources engaged in crop-livestock integration, and participating actors and their arrangements. Application of the framework onto six case studies all across the world (Asia, Europe and America) demonstrated it can be utilized for various projects implemented at multiple organizational levels (farm-to-farm, local groups, and regional levels) over distinct farming systems (conventional and organic). Specific policies should be developed to strengthen social networks through the mutual understanding of such integration benefits, since they play a key role in lowering the costs of information gathering and collective decision-making. A legal framework to establishing a formal contract should contribute to lower long-term monitoring costs, especially when trust among actors developing. Operational costs largely depend on the spatial proximity of farms, but this can be overcome by extending the scale of integration in terms of covered area and number of participants. Here, appropriate coordination by third-party entities is essential, and should be targeted by financial and technical support.

AB Purpose This paper aims to examine the contributions of hybrid organisations to wellbeing in small Pacific island countries.
   Design/methodology/approach The concept and different forms of hybrid organisations are examined, and then the operation and contributions to wellbeing of three Fijian hybrid organisations are considered.
   Findings Hybrid organisations in this region operate with a commitment to the common good and an ethic of care. Fijian hybrid organisations improve social and economic wellbeing for individuals, families and communities by providing employment, schools and training facilities, financial and support services, sustainable agriculture projects and facilitating networking. These services improve individual and community social and economic wellbeing, build resilience, add to personal and family security, offer opportunities for the future, advance leadership skills and sustain the environment. Commercial activities that support these organisations in their wellbeing endeavours include product sales, service fees, project levies and investment income.
   Research limitations/implications Generalisability beyond the Pacific region is not assured, as this review only examines hybrid organisations in small Pacific island countries.
   Practical implications Hybrid organisations offer an alternative pathway to achieve a sustainable enterprise economy, an approach that is more culturally relevant for the Pacific region. Policies to nurture the development of these organisations, and research into the startup, operation, impact and effectiveness of different hybrid organisation models would help to improve wellbeing in this region. International charities and aid agencies could advance the wellbeing of people living in this region by supporting the development of hybrid organisations. External agencies seeking to support hybrid organisation development are advised to consider providing funding through a regional agency rather than engaging directly with national governments.
   Social implications Developing a robust hybrid organisation sector will improve social and economic wellbeing for people living in small island nations.
   Originality/value As one of the first studies to examine wellbeing and hybrid organisations, this review adds to hybrid business theory by its consideration of small Pacific island countries. The authors add to existing understandings of how hybrid organisations contribute to social and economic wellbeing for individuals, families and communities. The review identifies each form hybrid organisational form adopts. Each has a central commitment to generating social and economic value but different revenue sources. The review adds valuable new knowledge to the limited scholarship of this region by identifying the philosophical foundations and contributions to wellbeing of these hybrid organisations. A future research agenda and policy development process is proposed to improve wellbeing and advance hybrid organisations in the region.

AB A comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the coupled Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) and Chemical Transport Model (CTM) (CCAM-CTM) for the New South Wales Greater Metropolitan Region (NSW GMR) was conducted based on modelling results for two periods coinciding with measurement campaigns undertaken during the Sydney Particle Study (SPS), namely the summer in 2011 (SPS1) and the autumn in 2012 (SPS2). The model performance was evaluated for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) against air quality data from the NSW Government's air quality monitoring network, and PM2.5 components were compared with speciated PM measurements from the Sydney Particle Study's Westmead sampling site. The model tends to overpredict PM2.5 with normalised mean bias (NMB) less than 20%, however, moderate underpredictions of the daily peak are found on high PM2.5 days. The PM2.5 predictions at all sites comply with performance criteria for mean fractional bias (MFB) of +/- 60%, but only PM2.5 predictions at Earlwood further comply with the performance goal for MFB of +/- 30% during both periods. The model generally captures the diurnal variations in ozone with a slight underestimation. The model also tends to underpredict daily maximum hourly ozone. Ozone predictions across regions in SPS1, as well as in Sydney East, Sydney Northwest and Illawarra regions in SPS2 comply with the benchmark of MFB of +/- 15%, however, none of the regions comply with the benchmark for mean fractional error (MFE) of 35%. The model reproduces the diurnal variations and magnitudes of NO2 well, with a slightly underestimating tendency across the regions. The MFE and normalised mean error (NME) for NO2 predictions fall well within the ranges inferred from other studies. Model results are within a factor of two of measured averages for sulphate, nitrate, sodium and organic matter, with elemental carbon, chloride, magnesium and ammonium being underpredicted. The overall performance of CCAM-CTM modelling system for the NSW GMR is comparable to similar model predictions by other regional airshed models documented in the literature. The performance of the modelling system is found to be variable according to benchmark criteria and depend on the location of the sites, as well as the time of the year. The benchmarking of CCAM-CTM modelling system supports the application of this model for air quality impact assessment and policy scenario modelling to inform air quality management in NSW.

TI Histories of the late nineteenth to early twentieth century immigration
   and our time
SO CURRENT SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Globalisation; humanitarianism; labour history; migrant; transit labour
AB Recent studies on welfare state and schemes suggest a different way of understanding modern governance in which the study of the nation is not at the centre of political understanding. Instead, of significance in such studies is the inadequately explored history of governing a mobile, unruly world of population flows. These works have given us a sense of the hidden histories of conflicts, desperate survivals, and new and old networks. Studies of hunger in the nineteenth century, of itinerant movements, transportations of coolies, spread of famines, shipping of children and adult women, trafficking in sex and labour, and pieces of welfare legislation to cope with this great infamy tell us how actually we have arrived at our own time of subject formation. This is certainly different from conventional nation-centred histories. Working within this new strand of history writing, labour historians have tried to recognise the political significance of labour migration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Their works suggest a different way of writing the history of the nation form in the last two centuries, where the extra-nationalist narrative of mobile labour constitutes a different universe. Through all these studies two issues have come closer as marks of modern time - on one hand mixed up, messy, population flows, provoking desperate governmental responses, on the other hand innovations at a furious pace in humanitarian methods, functions, institutions and principles. Modern humanitarianism had to combine the old techniques with new ones of care, protection, information gathering, interference, intervention and invention of a skewed theory of sovereignty, a one-sided theory of responsibility, and the gigantic humanitarian machines which would be likened to the transnational corporations (TNCs). In practical terms this means today managing the societies which produce the obdurate refugees and migrants to stop them from leaving the shores, to keep them within the national territorial confines, and eventually to manage societies in an enlightened way'. Managing moving population groups became the deus ex machina of modern governmentality. This will not be a straightforward history, as national, gender-related, race, and several other factors contributed to the making of a hugely heterogeneous labour market. The subjectivities produced in that process have contributed to the contentious history of our time.

AB Challenges calling for integrated approaches to health, such as the One Health (OH) approach, typically arise from the intertwined spheres of humans, animals, and ecosystems constituting their environment. Initiatives addressing such wicked problems commonly consist of complex structures and dynamics. As a result of the EU COST Action (TD 1404) "Network for Evaluation of One Health"(NEOH), we propose an evaluation framework anchored in systems theory to address the intrinsic complexity of OH initiatives and regard them as subsystems of the context within which they operate. Typically, they intend to influence a system with a view to improve human, animal, and environmental health. The NEOH evaluation framework consists of four overarching elements, namely: (1) the definition of the initiative and its context, (2) the description of the theory of change with an assessment of expected and unexpected outcomes, (3) the process evaluation of operational and supporting infrastructures (the "OH-ness"), and (4) an assessment of the association(s) between the process evaluation and the outcomes produced. It relies on a mixed methods approach by combining a descriptive and qualitative assessment with a semi-quantitative scoring for the evaluation of the degree and structural balance of "OH-ness"(summarised in an OH-index and OH-ratio, respectively) and conventional metrics for different outcomes in a multi-criteria-decision-analysis. Here, we focus on the methodology for Elements (1) and (3) including ready-to-use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for the assessment of the "OH-ness". We also provide an overview of Element (2), and refer to the NEOH handbook for further details, also regarding Element (4) (http://neoh.onehealthglobal. net). The presented approach helps researchers, practitioners, and evaluators to conceptualise and conduct evaluations of integrated approaches to health and facilitates comparison and learning across different OH activities thereby facilitating decisions on resource allocation. The application of the framework has been described in eight case studies in the same Frontiers research topic and provides first data on OH-index and OH-ratio, which is an important step towards their validation and the creation of a dataset for future benchmarking, and to demonstrate under which circumstances OH initiatives provide added value compared to disciplinary or conventional health initiatives.

AB The study aims to find out how the management of non-industrial private forests (NIPF) can be improved by a larger and more consistent participation of all important stakeholders involved in making one of the most important decisions the forest management planning system copes with: whether or not the forest planner shall create a separate forest management unit for NIPFs, considering a wider variety of interconnected benefits, costs risks and opportunities.
   The decision making process was conceived as an Analytic Network Process (ANP) and all important aspects worth being taken into consideration were embodied in four conceptual subnets that gather benefits, opportunities costs and risks defined from three different perspectives: social, economic and ecological. The method was tested on an important decision which is made each ten years when the forest management plans shall be updated. The input data were collected from two small associations of landowners whose forests are managed by Solca forest district (FD), county of Suceava, Romania. The total forest area supposed to be included in the new management unit is about 360 ha and the natural type of forest is beech, mixed with silver fir. Two alternatives were taken into account: the business as usual scenario (the same rotation for all stands and the same silvicultural system, irrespective to the ownership type) and a new management unit, explicitly designed for NIPF, where coppice with standards will produce fuelwood and small size round wood for rural construction.
   An extensive survey was carried out in order to find out the most important criteria worth being taken into account when such a decision shall be made, as well as the landowners' expectations, concerns and uncertainties with respect to the two options: business as usual scenario and a new FMU respectively. A second survey was distributed among the villagers of a neighboring commune in order to appraise the local demand for fuelwood. Based on the information collected at the first hand four subnets referring to benefits, costs, opportunities and risks have been produced and, within each subnet, three different clusters were defined in order to appraise the relative importance of economic, social, and ecologic aspects. Making pairwise comparisons between alternatives against criteria, dusters, and subnets, we have concluded that a new management unit for NIPFs is feasible and desirable. Even though ANP seems to be a very flexible tool for making complex decisions, any potential user shall be aware of some risks pertaining to ANP methodology, especially the tendency to make too complex networks, compelling to pairwise comparisons that make less sense. On the other hand, the case study presented in this article has demonstrated that pairwise comparisons may refer not only to the relative importance of whatever two criteria or alternatives, but also to the likelihood or desirability of some certain processes that might occur in case of pursuing one of the two alternatives taken into consideration. The procedure we have proposed for making or not making a new FMU can be developed or adapted to other situations where a consistent dialogue between the decision makers and the stakeholders is a more than necessary.

AB There are currently competing demands on Europe's forests and the finite resources and services that they can offer. Forestry intensification that aims at mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation is one example. Whether or not these two objectives compete can be evaluated by comparative studies of forest landscapes with different histories. We test the hypothesis that indicators of wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related in a gradient of long to short forestry intensification histories. Forest management data containing stand age, volume and tree species were used to model the opportunity for wood production and biodiversity conservation in five north European forest regions representing a gradient in landscape history from very long in the West and short in the East. Wood production indicators captured the supply of coniferous wood and total biomass, as well as current accessibility by transport infrastructure. Biodiversity conservation indicators were based on modelling habitat network functionality for focal bird species dependent on different combinations of stand age and tree species composition representing naturally dynamic forests. In each region we randomly sampled 25 individual 100-km(2) areas with contiguous forest cover. Regarding wood production, Sweden's Bergslagen region had the largest areas of coniferous wood, followed by Vitebsk in Belarus and Zemgale in Latvia. NW Russia's case study regions in Pskov and Komi had the lowest values, except for the biomass indicator. The addition of forest accessibility for transportation made the Belarusian and Swedish study region most suitable for wood and biomass production, followed by Latvia and two study regions in NW Russian. Regarding biodiversity conservation, the overall rank among regions was opposite. Mixed and deciduous habitats were functional in Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Old Scots pine and Norway spruce habitats were only functional in Komi. Thus, different regional forest histories provide different challenges in terms of satisfying both wood production and biodiversity conservation objectives in a forest management unit. These regional differences in northern Europe create opportunities for exchanging experiences among different regional contexts about how to achieve both objectives. We discuss this in the context of land-sharing versus land-sparing. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI "Pushing the Boat Out": A Meta-synthesis of How Members, Staff and
   Family Experience the Clubhouse Model

AB To explore how member, staff, and family experience the contributions of the clubhouse model to outcomes for adults with severe mental illness. Given the significant role social and vocational arenas play in promoting wellbeing, irrespective of health status, explorations of the role such arenas can play in helping individuals accomplish their life and vocational goals may be useful in guiding policy and practice. A metaethnography was conducted using 11 qualitative studies published between 2000 and 2015. Four themes and an overarching metaphor were identified: (1) Stepping out of limiting realities; (2) anchoring; (3) creating ways of flourishing; and (4) prospects of a life outside the clubhouse. Pushing out the boat as a metaphor holds promise in facilitating discussions about the subjective outcomes of the clubhouse model and for expanding knowledge about clubhouses as multi-dimensional programs that provide social, educational, and vocational opportunities for adults recovering from mental health problems. Our findings show that clubhouses are valuable communities for meaningful doings for individuals to build self-confidence, relations, and perspectiveall crucial for processes of recovery. Clubhouses provide people a place to establish an anchor in a supportive environment where they can try things out and regain their self-confidence. From there, they may choose to push their boat out. However, many members might need to choose not tothe seas may be too rough or their boat may not yet be strong enough for the journey. Further research is needed to examine members' experiences with integration into mainstream social networks and employment. It will also be important to examine how practitioners can intentionally interact with Clubhouse members and their families to promote the individuals' processes of social integration outside the clubhouse.

AB Internet of Things application (IOT) in supply chain management is becoming imperative and can shape a strategic competitive advantage. Albeit, different challenges appear through this application, most of the previous studies consider less about these challenges and focus on the advantages of IOT. To overcome this defect, different challenges that a supply chain may face as whole are determined based on systematic literature review and expert opinions. Then, a rough group decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is applied. Advantages of the proposed model are that both internal strength and external influence of challenges and also vagueness and ambiguity of experts' opinions are simultaneously noticed to completely show the importance of these challenges. The results show that challenges such as lack of strategy and scenario planning in IOT, storage issues, lack of security and lack of privacy are of great importance. So, these challenges should have a higher priority in attracting attention and resources. These results help managers to be equipped to face with main challenges in their path toward IOT in their supply chains. Accordingly some practical suggestions for managers are discussed in this paper, such as starting the journey toward IOT step by step, planning for a data storage system which is appropriate for big data, setting up a security policy to prevent out-coming problems caused by lack of security and privacy inherited by IOT, conducting a privacy or security risk assessment, minimizing the data collection and retain and testing the security measures before launching the products, and establishment of a legal framework to construct a problem-solving network in such a messed up and dynamic environment for processing such complicated huge data.

TI Determining the impact of pre-radiation treatment verification
   simulation/dry run by analyzing intradepartmental reported incidents and
   surveying staff and patients
SO PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
LA English

AB Purpose: Error identification in radiation therapy is critical to maintain a safe and efficient therapeutic environment. A verification simulation (VS; also called a dry run for patient information) provides a dedicated time prior to treatment to duplicate steps of patient setup, imaging, and treatment process as a final quality assurance step. Through the use of surveys and analysis of reported incidents, we sought to determine the value of a VS before initiating patient treatment.
   Methods and materials: In November 2014, a VS was instituted across our network of 11 radiation oncology clinics. A comparison of the incident rate reported through our departmental incident learning system (ILS) was made between a non-VS group (965 patients who were treated in the 18 months prior to instituting the VS) and a VS group (984 patients who were treated over 18 months with the VS policy in place). From August to December 2016, surveys were completed by 211 patients and 55 physicians, nurses, and therapists detailing their perspectives on the VS.
   Results: There were 28 incidents (2.9%) in the non-VS group compared with 18 incidents (1.8%) in the VS group (P = .03). In the VS group, more incidents were detected before the day of treatment (P = .03) and fewer incidents on the day of treatment (P = .02). In addition, a trend toward fewer incidents after treatment started (P = .09) was observed. Patient surveys indicated that 99.5% of patients were informed of the VS, 83% reported decreased anxiety during treatment, and 5% indicated concerns about delaying treatment. The majority of staff members (67%) were satisfied with the VS.
   Conclusions: A VS helps identify and correct incidents before the administration of radiation therapy and reduces patient anxiety. (C) 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The Moderating Effect of Guanxi on the Dynamic Capacity and Competitive
   Advantage of Chinese International Contractors

AB With the active support of the national policy "One Belt and One Road" Initiative, Chinese contractors seized this historic opportunity to accelerate strategic globalization, and they gradually stood out in international construction projects owing to their low-cost advantage. However, despite China having large-scale contractors and wide-range business, compared to developed countries, a considerably large gap still exists. China is confronted with complex and changeable international projects filled with increasing competition. Thus, it is both a focus issue and a major task for Chinese international contractors, and many scholars, to consider how Chinese contractors can obtain and maintain long-term competitive advantages to improve their capabilities in response to dynamic environmental changes. Therefore, the objectives of this study are (1) to study the influence of the dynamic capability of Chinese contractors on competitive advantage in a project and (2) to explore the moderating effect of Chinese guanxi on the dynamic capability and competitive advantage of Chinese international contractors. This study primarily aimed at researching the impact of dynamic capacity of Chinese contractors on competitive advantage and the moderating effects of Chinese guanxi. The findings suggest that the environmental perception capability and the integration and coordination capability of the dynamic capability have a significant positive effect on the project competitive advantage; business guanxi positively moderates the relationship between the environmental perception capability and the competitive advantage. Business guanxi also negatively moderates the relationship between learning ability and competitive advantage, while political guanxi negatively moderates the relationship between the environmental perception capability and competitive advantage. This paper contributes to the construction management literature not only by providing empirical evidence on the dynamic capability and competitive advantage of Chinese contractors but also by expanding guanxi research. The results may also help Chinese contractors by providing strategic reform guidance and sustainable development in international construction projects.

AB Historians of the future may well describe 2018 as the year that the world's first functional synthetic eukaryotic genome became a reality. Without the benefit of hindsight, it might be hard to completely grasp the long-term significance of a breakthrough moment in the history of science like this. The role of synthetic biology in the imminent birth of a budding Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cell carrying 16 man-made chromosomes causes the world of science to teeter on the threshold of a future-defining scientific frontier. The genome-engineering tools and technologies currently being developed to produce the ultimate yeast genome will irreversibly connect the dots between our improved understanding of the fundamentals of a complex cell containing its DNA in a specialised nucleus and the application of bioengineered eukaryotes designed for advanced biomanufacturing of beneficial products. By joining up the dots between the findings and learnings from the international Synthetic Yeast Genome project (known as the Yeast 2.0 or Sc2.0 project) and concurrent advancements in biodesign tools and smart data-intensive technologies, a future world powered by a thriving bioeconomy seems realistic. This global project demonstrates how a collaborative network of dot connectors-driven by a tinkerer's indomitable curiosity to understand how things work inside a eukaryotic cell-are using cutting-edge biodesign concepts and synthetic biology tools to advance science and to positively frame human futures (i.e. improved quality of life) in a planetary context (i.e. a sustainable environment). Explorations such as this have a rich history of resulting in unexpected discoveries and unanticipated applications for the benefit of people and planet. However, we must learn from past explorations into controversial futuristic sciences and ensure that researchers at the forefront of an emerging science such as synthetic biology remain connected to all stakeholders' concerns about the biosafety, bioethics and regulatory aspects of their pioneering work. This article presents a shared vision of constructing a synthetic eukaryotic genome in a safe model organism by using novel concepts and advanced technologies. This multidisciplinary and collaborative project is conducted under a sound governance structure that does not only respect the scientific achievements and lessons from the past, but that is also focussed on leading the present and helping to secure a brighter future for all.

AB Background: Since public transit infrastructure affects road traffic volumes and influences transportation mode choice, which in turn impacts health, it is important to estimate the alteration of the health burden linked with transit policies.
   Objective: We quantified the variation in health benefits and burden between a business as usual (BAU) and a public transit (PT) scenarios in 2031 (with 8 and 19 new subway and train stations) for the greater Montreal region.
   Method: Using mode choice and traffic assignment models, we predicted the transportation mode choice and traffic assignment on the road network. Subsequently, we estimated the distance travelled in each municipality by mode, the minutes spent in active transportation, as well as traffic emissions. Thereafter we estimated the health burden attributed to air pollution and road traumas and the gains associated with active transportation for both the BAU and PT scenarios.
   Results: We predicted a slight decrease of overall trips and kilometers travelled by car as well as an increase of active transportation for the PT in 2031 vs the BAU. Our analysis shows that new infrastructure will reduce the overall burden of transportation by 2.5 DALYs per 100,000 persons. This decrease is caused by the reduction of road traumas occurring in the inner suburbs and central Montreal region as well as gains in active transportation in the inner suburbs.
   Conclusion: Based on the results of our study, transportation planned public transit projects for Montreal are unlikely to reduce drastically the burden of disease attributable to road vehicles and infrastructures in the Montreal region. The impact of the planned transportation infrastructures seems to be very low and localized mainly in the areas where new public transit stations are

AB Globalization has brought about significant human mobility, along with developments in IT and transportation since the early 1990s, the case of East Asia is no exception. While a huge number of workers in developing countries have been migrating to work abroad, a growing number of women have been migrating, specifically seeking to marry men in East Asia. This paper aims to elucidate which migration theories illustrate labor and/or marriage migration and incorporation in East Asia, particularly in the cases of Japan and Korea, while also examining their overall migration and incorporation patterns. In turn it investigates which factors significantly and differentially affect each type of migration at multiple levels: the macro-, meso-, and micro-levels. Labor migrants are usually excluded from incorporation in their host countries, especially even the case of ethnic Korean from the former Soviet Union countries, Koryoins, as labor migrants have been excluded in such integration with the reality of the forgotten and disconnected history. On the other hand, marriage migrants have been occasionally included in such integration. Although there has been a significant transition in the migration system theory of labor migration, there is still room to develop the better and more supportive systems. At present taking into consideration the multi-level structures, the migration network theory seems better in explaining marriage migration into the host countries of East Asia. Overall, the differentiated migratory incorporation theory which I suggest could best account for the cases in Japan and Korea when we consider international migration and the extent of social integration. So as to systematically manage labor migration problems and address the problems of commercialized matchmaking business, it requires sharing ideas with grassroots organizations and making concerted efforts to implement anti-discrimination laws and develop policies between the local governments in Japan and Korea. At the same time, education and media can be utilized strategically to enhance the attitudes toward international migrants.

AB Background-The cardiovascular effects of low-level environmental radiation exposures are poorly understood. Although particulate matter (PM) has been linked to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and elevated blood pressure (BP), the properties promoting its toxicity remain uncertain. Addressing a knowledge gap, we evaluated whether BP increased with higher exposures to radioactive components of ambient PM, herein referred to as particle radioactivity (PR).
   Methods and Results-We performed a repeated-measures analysis of 852 men to examine associations between PR exposure and BP using mixed-effects regression models. As a surrogate for PR, we used gross activity, measured by the US Environmental Protection Agency's radiation monitoring network. Higher PR exposure was associated with increases in both diastolic BP and systolic BP, for exposures from 1 to 28 days. An interquartile range increase in 28-day PR exposure was associated with a 2.95-mm Hg increase in diastolic BP (95% confidence interval, 2.25-3.66; P<0.001) and a 3.94-mm Hg increase in systolic BP (95% confidence interval, 2.62-5.27; P<0.001). For models including both PR and PM <= 2.5 mu m, the PR-BP associations remained stable and significant. For models including PR and black carbon or PR and particle number, the PR-BP associations were attenuated; however, they remained significant for many exposure durations.
   Conclusions-This is the first study to demonstrate the potential adverse effects of PR on both systolic and diastolic BPs. These were independent and similar in magnitude to those of PM 2.5 mu m, black carbon, and particle number. Understanding the effects of particle-bound radionuclide exposures on BP may have important implications for environmental and public health policy.

AB Urban air pollutant distribution is a concern in environmental and health studies. Particularly, the spatial distribution of NO2 and PM2.5, which represent photochemical smog and haze pollution in urban areas, is of concern. This paper presents a study quantifying the seasonal differences between urban NO2 and PM2.5 distributions in Foshan, China. A geographical semi-variogram analysis was conducted to delineate the spatial variation in daily NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The data were collected from 38 sites in the government-operated monitoring network. The results showed that the total spatial variance of NO2 is 38.5% higher than that of PM2.5. The random spatial variance of NO2 was 1.6 times than that of PM2.5. The nugget effect (i.e., random to total spatial variance ratio) values of NO2 and PM2.5 were 29.7 and 20.9%, respectively. This indicates that urban NO2 distribution was affected by both local and regional influencing factors, while urban PM2.5 distribution was dominated by regional influencing factors. NO2 had a larger seasonally averaged spatial autocorrelation distance (48 km) than that of PM2.5 (33 km). The spatial range of NO2 autocorrelation was larger in winter than the other seasons, and PM2.5 has a smaller range of spatial autocorrelation in winter than the other seasons. Overall, the geographical semi-variogram analysis is a very effective method to enrich the understanding of NO2 and PM2.5 distributions. It can provide scientific evidences for the buffering radius selection of spatial predictors for land use regression models. It will also be beneficial for developing the targeted policies and measures to reduce NO2 and PM2.5 pollution levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Subjective Well-Being in an Era of Relentless Growth: The Case of Turkey
   Between 2004 and 2014

AB This paper analyses the subjective well-being levels in Turkey between 2004 and 2014 by relying on Turkish Statistical Institute's Life Satisfaction Surveys. This is the first study ever suggesting an alternative well-being approach for Turkish population based on subjective measures. Inspired from the Bhutan's Gross National Happiness and Cummins et al.'s (2003) Australian Unity Well-Being Index approaches, we constructed several subjective well-being indexes for the first time in Turkey. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) Despite GDP per capita (in current $) doubles between 2004 and 2014 period, constructed indexes show slight increments or stagnate around some level. (2) We found a slight support for Frey and Stutzer's (2002a) argument that GDP per capita is insensible after some threshold. (3) National well-being indicators are found to be more volatile than individual well-being indicators, which hints that individuals may be using their informal social networks as a shelter from the economic and politic fluctuations in the country. (4) Much of the volatility in subjective well-being indexes are caused by psychological well-being indicators. Previous results indicate that as basic requirements of a society are met after some level of per capita income, non-materialistic aspirations- like happiness, freedom or justice-started to surpass materialistic aspirations. Same is true for Turkey- this led us to conclude that the reductionist approach of delegating the solution of social and ecological problems to economic growth process may lie beneath this dismal outcome in Turkey in the last decade. Thus, we recommend policy-makers to upkeep with the reform process which would make economic and political system more transparent and competitive, which in turn, help to ameliorate the channels through which individuals fulfil their aspirations.

AB Background: Women health volunteers (WHVs) are a link between people and healthcare workers. Despite their key role in promoting community health, strategies are rarely designed to keep them volunteering. The aim of this research was to find successful strategies to overcome barriers to recruitment and retention of the volunteers in assigned activities.
   Subjects and methods: A three-round online national Delphi technique was used to ask the opinions of Iranian health volunteers' supervisors and the relevant researchers. At the first round, the participants were asked ten open-ended questions across four barriers: inadequate capability of the volunteers and trainers, inadequate acceptance of the volunteers, restrictive social norms, and organizational problems. At the second round, with the questionnaire consisting of closed-ended questions, the experts were asked to rank the feasibility of each strategy using a seven-point Likert scale. Items along with the feedback received from the second round were included in the third-round questionnaire. Strategies with a median of 6 or higher and with an interquartile range <= 1 were regarded to be feasible.
   Results: Consensus was obtained on 100 of the 133 strategies. A mixture of improving group work, implementing motivation tactics, assessing the needs of people/WHVs, reforming policy, monitoring and evaluation of WHVs/trainers, mobilizing the community, empowering WHVs/trainers, rationalizing WHVs/trainers/people, improving intersectional collaboration, implementing problem-based approaches, allocating proper resources, appropriate recruitment of WHVs, using social networks, and information dissemination were found to be the effective strategies to overcome the barriers to active participation.
   Conclusion: The highest consensuses among experts were on implementing motivation tactics and mobilizing the community. It seems that community mobilization, incentives, and logistical supplies such as providing prizes and transportation facilities for volunteers are mechanisms that can help retain WHVs and also overcome barriers to their active participation.

TI Emotional modelling and classification of a large-scale collection of

SO PLOS ONE
LA English

ID MAPREDUCE; ASSOCIATIONS; REDUCTION; ALGORITHM; POLICY
AB The development of network technology and the popularization of image capturing devices have led to a rapid increase in the number of digital images available, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify a desired image from among the massive number of possible images. Images usually contain rich semantic information, and people usually understand images at a high semantic level. Therefore, achieving the ability to use advanced technology to identify the emotional semantics contained in images to enable emotional semantic image classification remains an urgent issue in various industries. To this end, this study proposes an improved OCC emotion model that integrates personality and mood factors for emotional modelling to describe the emotional semantic information contained in an image. The proposed classification system integrates the k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The MapReduce parallel programming model was used to adapt the KNN-SVM algorithm for parallel implementation in the Hadoop cluster environment, thereby achieving emotional semantic understanding for the classification of a massive collection of images. For training and testing, 70,000scene images were randomly selected from the SUN Database. The experimental results indicate that users with different personalities show overall consistency in their emotional understanding of the same image. For a training sample size of 50,000, the classification accuracies for different emotional categories targeted at users with different personalities were approximately 95%, and the training time was only 1/5 of that required for the corresponding algorithm with a single-node architecture. Furthermore, the speedup of the system also showed a linearly increasing tendency. Thus, the experiments achieved a good classification effect and can lay a foundation for classification in terms of additional types of emotional image semantics, thereby demonstrating the practical significance of the proposed model.

AB Improving technology and increasing affordability mean that camera trappingthe use of remotely triggered cameras to photograph wildlifeis becoming an increasingly common tool in the monitoring and conservation of wild populations. Each camera trap study generates a vast amount of data, which need to be processed and labeled before analysis. Traditionally, processing camera trap data has been performed manually by entering data into a spreadsheet. This is time-consuming, prone to human error, and data management may be inconsistent between projects, hindering collaboration. Recently, several programs have become available to facilitate and quicken data processing. Here, we review available software and assess their ability to better standardize camera trap data management and facilitate data sharing and collaboration. To identify available software for camera trap data management, we used internet searches and contacted researchers and practitioners working on large camera trap projects, as well as software developers. We tested all available programs against a range of software characteristics in addition to their ability to record a suite of important data variables extracted from images. We identified and reviewed 12 available programs for the management of camera trap data. These ranged from simple software assisting with the extraction of metadata from an image, through to comprehensive programs that facilitate data entry and analysis. Many of the programs tested were developed for use on specific studies and so do not cover all possible software or data collection requirements that different projects may have. We highlight the importance of a standardized software solution for camera trap data management. This approach would allow all possible data to be collected, enabling researchers to share data and contribute to other studies, as well as facilitating multi-project comparisons. By standardizing camera trap data collection and management in this way, future studies would be better placed to guide conservation policy on a global level.

ID NIGHT-SKY BRIGHTNESS
AB The introduction of blue rich colour, Correlated-Colour-Temperature (CCT) 6000K road lighting could increase skyglow significantly compared with CCT 3000 K types, if the blue content reaches the sky.
   Highways England have a policy for lighting specification on motorways advised by the author's work. This is a categorised environmental impact point system of summed brightness as a function of angle from vertically down to the cut off angle; but with no CCT limitation. Modelling was done for Malvern-Hills Area-of-Outstanding-Natural-Beauty (MHAONB), for the nighttime environmental impact of the LED replacement of Low-Pressure-Sodium throughout Herefordshire. The study was extended to include High-Pressure-Sodium and to LEDs at several CCTs, for the same Photopic ground illuminance.
   Dark-Sky-Survey geographic location results for the MHAONB (2012) are described. Near-Zenith sky brightness photometry became continuous from 2016 at 2 minute intervals in all weathers, not just clear nights, with a networked calibrated Unihedron Lensed Sky Quality Meter (LSQM). Samples were also taken of all-sky camera images, corrected for vignetting and near-Zenith calibrated with the LSQM, to study weather effects, Milky Way contribution, and Herefordshire lighting conversion to blue-rich LEDs (2013-15), compared with the less converted Severn valley direction.
   Time-plots and histogram analysis showed a small reduction in brightness (2012-2018), 0.1 mag.arcsec(-2). Most variation is from increased sampling of distant cloud cover effects. Mist or low cloud on the horizon obscures light sources beyond reducing local skyglow, while high cloud reflects, increasing clear sky brightness. The Milky Way is critically 20% above background. Darkest periods near Zenith reach 21.1 mag.arcsec(-2), to 21.2 after rain or surrounding low-cloud or poor-visibility. Clear-sky brightness decreases into early hours (similar to 0.03 mag.arcsec(-2)/h); dimming effects were not seen.
   The Zenith brightness is still set by distant cities, while towards the horizon, commercial and private uncontrolled non-directional LED lighting is increasing, negating the improvements in road lighting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Slum dwellers display specific traits when it comes to disclosing their illnesses to professionals. The resulting actions lead to poor health-seeking behaviour and underutilisation of existing formal health facilities. The ways that slum people use to communicate their feelings about illness, the type of confidants that they choose, and the supportive and unsupportive social and cultural interactions to which they are exposed have not yet been studied in the Indian context, which constitutes an important knowledge gap for Indian policymakers and practitioners alike. To that end, this study examines the patterns of illness disclosure in Indian slums and the underpinning factors which shape the slum dwellers' disclosing attitude.
   Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted among 105 men and 113 women who experienced illness in the year prior to the study period. Respondents were selected from four urban slums in two Indian cities, Bangalore and Kolkata.
   Results: Findings indicate that women have more confidants at different social levels, while men have a limited network of disclosures which is culturally and socially mediated. Gender role limitations, exclusion from peer groups and unsupportive local situations are the major cause of disclosure delay or non-disclosure among men, while the main concerns for women are a lack of proper knowledge about illness, unsupportive responses received from other people on certain occasions, the fear of social stigma, material loss and the burden of the local situation. Prompt sharing of illness among men is linked with prevention intention and coping with biological problems, whereas factors determining disclosure for women relate to ensuring emotional and instrumental safety, preventing collateral damage of illness, and preventing and managing biological complications.
   Conclusions: The findings reveal that patterns of disclosure are not determined by the acknowledgment of illness but largely depend on the interplay between individual agency, disclosure consequences and the socio cultural environment. The results of this study can contribute significantly to mitigating the pivotal knowledge gap between health policymakers, practitioners and patients, leading to the formulation of policies that maximise the utilisation of health facilities in slums.

AB Background: South-south collaboration on health and development research is a critical mechanism for social and economic progress. It allows sharing and replicating experiences to find a "southern solution" to meet shared health challenges, such as access to adequate HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. This study aimed to generate evidence on the dynamics of south-south collaboration in HIV/AIDS research, which could ultimately inform stakeholders on the progress and nature of collaboration towards increased research capacities in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC).
   Methods: Bibliometric and social network analysis methods were used to assess the 10-year (2006-2015) scientific contribution of LMIC, through the analysis of scientific publications on HIV/AIDS prevention and/or treatment. Five dimensions oriented the study: knowledge production, co-authorship analysis, research themes mapping, research types classification and funding sources.
   Results: Publications involving LMIC have substantially increased overtime, despite small expression of south-south collaboration. Research themes mapping revealed that publication focus varied according to collaborating countries' income categories, from diagnosis, opportunistic infections and laboratory-based research (LMIC single or LMIC-LMIC) to human behavior and healthcare, drug therapy and mother to child transmission (LMIC-HIC). The analysis of research types showed that south-south collaborations frequently targeted social sciences issues. Funding agencies acknowledged in south-south collaboration also showed diverse focus: LMIC-based funders tended to support basic biomedical research whereas international/HIC-based funders seem to cover predominantly social sciences-oriented research.
   Conclusions: Although the global environment has fostered an increasing participation of LMIC in collaborative learning models, south-south collaboration on HIV/AIDS prevention and/or treatment research seemed to be lower than expected, stressing the need for strategies to foster these partnerships. The evidence presented in this study can be used to strengthen a knowledge platform to inform future policy, planning and funding decisions, contributing to the development of enhanced collaboration and a priority research agenda for LMICs.

ID HEALTH-CARE
AB Background: Quality Improvement (QI) initiatives in primary care are effective at improving uptake of evidence based guidelines, but are difficult to implement and sustain. In Australia meso-level health organisations such as Primary health care Organisations (PHCO) offer new opportunities to implement area-wide QI programs. This study sought to identify enablers and barriers to implementation of an existing Australian QI program and to identify strategic directions that PHCOs can use in the ongoing development of QI in this environment.
   Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 15 purposively selected program staff and participants from the Australian Primary Care Collaborative (APCC) QI program. Interviewees included seven people involved in design, administration and implementation of the APCC program and eight primary care providers (seven General Practitioners (GPs) and one practice nurse) who had participated in the program from 2004 to 2014. Interviewees were asked to describe their experience of the program and reflect on what enabled or impeded its implementation. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and iteratively analysed, with early analysis informing subsequent interviews. Identified themes and their implications were reviewed by a GP expert reference group.
   Results: Implementation enablers and barriers were grouped into five thematic areas: (1) leadership, particularly the identification and utilisation of change champions; (2) organisational culture that supports quality improvement; (3) funding incentives that support a culture of quality and innovation; (4) access to and use of accurate data; and 5) design and utilisation of clinical systems that enable and support these issues. In all of these areas, the active involvement of an overarching external support organisation was considered a key ingredient to successful implementation.
   Conclusion: There are substantial opportunities for PHCOs to play a pivotal role in QI implementation in Australia and internationally. In developing QI programs and policies, such organisations ought to invest their efforts in: (1) identifying and mentoring local leaders; (2) fostering QI culture via development of local peer networks; (3) developing and advocating for alternative funding models to support and incentivise these activities; (4) investing in data and audit tool infrastructure; and (5) facilitation of systems implementation within primary care practices.

AB Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces are diverse, phenotypically polythetic genera encompassing species important to the environment, economy, biotechnology and medicine, causing significant social impacts. Taxonomic studies on these fungi are essential since they could provide invaluable information on their evolutionary relationships and define criteria for species recognition. With the advancement of various biological, biochemical and computational technologies, different approaches have been adopted for the taxonomy of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces; for example, from traditional morphotyping, phenotyping to chemotyping (e.g. lipotyping, proteotypingand metabolotyping) and then mitogenotyping and/or phylotyping. Since different taxonomic approaches focus on different sets of characters of the organisms, various classification and identification schemes would result. In view of this, the consolidated species concept, which takes into account different types of characters, is recently accepted for taxonomic purposes and, together with the lately implemented 'One Fungus - One Name' policy, is expected to bring a more stable taxonomy for Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces, which could facilitate their evolutionary studies. The most significant taxonomic change for the three genera was the transfer of Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium to Talaromyces (e.g. the medically important thermally dimorphic 'P. marneffei' endemic in Southeast Asia is now named T. marneffei), leaving both Penicillium and Talaromyces as monophyletic genera. Several distantly related Aspergillus-like fungi were also segregated from Aspergillus, making this genus, containing members of both sexual and asexual morphs, monophyletic as well. In the current omics era, application of various state-of-the-art omics technologies is likely to provide comprehensive information on the evolution of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces and a stable taxonomy will hopefully be achieved.

AB Congenital heart defects (CHD) are structural malformations found at birth with a prevalence of 1%. The clinical trajectory of CHD is highly variable and thus in need of robust diagnostics and therapeutics. Major surgical interventions are often required for most CHDs. In Africa, despite advances in life sciences infrastructure and improving education of medical scholars, the limited clinical data suggest that CHD detection and correction are still not at par with the rest of the world. But the toll and genetics of CHDs in Africa has seldom been systematically investigated. We present an expert review on CHD with lessons learned on Africa. We found variable CHD phenotype prevalence in Africa across countries and populations. There are important gaps and paucity in genomic studies of CHD in African populations. Among the available genomic studies, the key findings in Africa were variants in GATA4 (P193H), MTHFR 677TT, and MTHFR 1298CC that were associated with atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect (VSD), Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and patent ductus arteriosus phenotypes and 22q.11 deletion, which is associated with TOF. There were no data on epigenomic association of CHD in Africa, however, other studies have shown an altered expression of miR-421 and miR-1233-3p to be associated with TOF and hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter of SCO2 gene also been associated with TOF and VSD in children with non-syndromic CHD. These findings signal the urgent need to develop and implement genetic and genomic research on CHD to identify the hereditary and genome-environment interactions contributing to CHD. These projected studies would also offer comparisons on CHD pathophysiology between African and other populations worldwide. Genomic research on CHD in Africa should be developed in parallel with next generation technology policy research and responsible innovation frameworks that examine the social and political factors that shape the emergence and societal embedding of new technologies.

AB Due to rigorous environmental legislations and competitive economics worldwide, a growing number of companies are devoted to recovering and remanufacturing used products. Consequently, over the past few decades, the management of manufacturing/remanufacturing systems has been receiving increasing attention from researchers and companies leaders. Most of the existing research papers in the literature considered that remanufactured products have the same quality and price as new ones. However, in practice, the market perceives new items as higher quality products rather than remanufactured items. This paper aims to bridge the gap in research on manufacturing/remanufacturing supply chain, by investigating an optimal storage and manufacturing/remanufacturing planning, while taking into consideration the difference between new and remanufactured items, random machine failures, carbon constraints and distinct random customer demands for both items types. Furthermore, to make our system more realistic, it is assumed that the return rate of used items depends on the sales in the past periods, machine repair time is stochastic and set-up time period is not negligible. In this study, two models are developed, considering carbon emissions or not, to determine the optimal values of the manufacturing/remanufacturing period lengths and serviceable stock capacities of new and remanufactured items. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the impact of set-up cost, percentage of returned used items, machine availability, carbon cap and carbon trading price on the optimal storage and production planning. Moreover, the influences of carbon cap, carbon trading price and percentage of returned used items on carbon emissions have been analyzed. The results reveal that set-up cost, percentage of returned used items and machine availability have significant impact on storage and production planning of new and remanufactured items. In addition, the results indicate that a lower carbon cap and/or a high carbon trading price, induce the producer to collect and remanufacture used items and curb carbon emissions.

AB Litterfall is a major, yet poorly studied, process within forest ecosystems globally. It is important for carbon dynamics, edaphic communities, and maintaining site fertility. Reliable information on the carbon and nutrient input from litterfall, provided by litter traps, is relevant to a wide audience including policy makers and soil scientists. We used litterfall observations of 320 plots from the pan-European forest monitoring network of the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests to quantify litterfall fluxes. Eight litterfall models were evaluated (four using climate information and four using biomass abundance). We scaled up our results to the total European forest area and quantified the contribution of litterfall to the forest carbon cycle using net primary production aggregated by bioregions (north, central, and south) and by forest types (conifers and broadleaves). The 1,604 analyzed annual litterfall observations indicated an average carbon input of 224gCm(-2)year(-1) (annual nutrient inputs 4.49gN, 0.32gP, and 1.05gKm(-2)), representing a substantial percentage of net primary production from 36% in north Europe to 32% in central Europe. The annual turnover of carbon and nutrient in broadleaf canopies was larger than for conifers. The evaluated models provide large-scale litterfall predictions with a bias less than 10%. Each year litterfall in European forests transfers 351TgC, 8.2TgN, 0.6TgP, and 1.9TgK to the forest floor. The performance of litterfall models may be improved by including foliage biomass and proxies for forest management.
   Plain Language Summary All plants shed parts of their biomass periodically. This litterfall is important for transferring carbon and nutrients from the canopy back to the soil. Every year in European forests about one third of carbon produced via photosynthesis falls to the forest floor as litterfall. Broadleaved trees shed more carbon and nutrients than conifers. Models can be used to quantify the average flux across Europe, but need improvement to be applicable at fine scales.

ID ECONOMIC-EVALUATION
AB One health thinking for health interventions is increasingly being used to capture previously unseen stakeholders and impacts across people, animals, and the environment. The Network for One Health Evaluation (NEOH) proposes a systems-based framework to quantitatively assess integration and highlight the added value (theory of change) that this approach will bring to a project. This case study will retrospectively evaluate the pioneering use of a One Health (OH) approach during an international collaboration (satellite project to tackle production losses due to tick-borne disease in cattle in Southern Zambia in late 1980s). The objective of the evaluation is twofold: retrospective evaluation the OH-ness of the satellite project and identification of costs and benefits. Data for evaluation was recovered from publications, project documents, and witness interviews. A mixed qualitative and quantitative evaluation was undertaken. In this case study, a transdisciplinary approach allowed for the identification of a serious public health risk arising from the unexpected reuse of chemical containers by the local public against advice. Should this pioneering project not have been completed then it is assumed this behavior could have had a large impact on public wellbeing and ultimately reduced regional productivity and compromised welfare. From the economic evaluation, the costs of implementing this OH approach, helping to avoid harm, were small in comparison to overall project costs. The overall OH Index was 0.34. The satellite project demonstrated good OH operations by managing to incorporate the input across multiple dimensions but was slightly weaker on OH infrastructures (OH Ratio = 1.20). These quantitative results can be used in the initial validation and benchmarking of this novel framework. Limitations of the evaluation were mainly a lack of data due to the length of time since project completion and a lack of formal monitoring of program impact. In future health strategy development and execution, routine monitoring and evaluation from an OH perspective (by utilizing the framework proposed by NEOH), could prove valuable or used as a tool for retrospective evaluation of existing policies.

DE public roads; land management and planning; forest land
AB The economic development of the country is very much dependent on the development of the transport infrastructure, which is one of the main priorities of the state policy included in the planning and development documents. Ensuring a efficiently funct offing transport system, primarily the network of roads, involves the need to improve the technical characteristics of existing roads or to build new sections. With the linear nature of road investments, we deal with interference in significant areas that have direct and indirect effects. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of investments realized for different categories of public roads on the area of land needed to be excluded from forest production. The structure and area of the land as well as the number of forest superintendents transferred areas were also analyzed. The study was conducted for forest areas managed by the State Forests National Forest Holding (SF NFH). Data on the area of the transferred forest land was obtained from SF NFH units and the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA). In the years 2012-2015, SF NFH units transferred the land into the management of GDDKiA 203 times with the total area of 617 ha. In the same period, the transfer of the land ownership to local government for voivodship, county and municipal roads took place in 388 cases and covered 556.6 ha. Since 2003 (i.e when special act on road investments came into force), the area of the transferred land amounted to 282.7 ha in Torun, 78.6 ha in Gdansk and 558.4 ha in Poznan regional directorates of the State Forests. There was a decrease in the area of the transferred lands depending on the category of public roads, while the highest number of events for municipal roads was observed. There is a great variability in the time, number and area of property transferred to public roads.

AB Farmland bird species have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades, especially in Mediterranean areas. The intensification of agricultural practices has led to reduced invertebrate prey, which represent the bulk of the diet of many farmland birds. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the diet of the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) during the breeding season, monitored over a five-year period between 2006 and 2013 in the Gela Plain (Sicily). Our aim was to understand whether, and to what extent, farming practices affected the reproductive outputs of this predominantly insectivore bird in order to find a profitable compromise between conservation of farmland birds and farming practices. During our study, lesser kestrel diet varied among farmland habitats, in terms of ingested biomass, prey items/pellet and diet breadth. This has reflected in the reproductive output because colonies characterised by a higher ingested biomass fledged more chicks than the others. The artichoke and grassland fields were found to provide the most beneficial dietary parameters. Unexpectedly, the intensive and high-profit artichoke farming might turn out to be suitable for lesser kestrels. Artichoke fields are chiefly used when abandoned after harvest, providing high prey availability and accessibility for kestrels during the brood raising stage of their breeding season. A mosaic of grassland and artichoke fields can thus be recommended for Mediterranean agricultural areas of the Natura2000 network, in which some intensive farming and lesser kestrels can coexist, if adequately framed in a friendly-to-wildlife agriculture policy. Such a potential optimal trade-off between avian population persistence and economic sustainability for farmers we have found, should be planned in alternative management of agro-ecosystems, enhancing the functioning of trophic chains. For our study area, we suggest at least farmers be: i) informed on the role of predators as biological agents for pest control; ii) granted to reduce the high level of chemicals currently used during cultivation in favour of organic farming; and iii) granted to maintain the artichoke fields until June, following completion of the harvest

DE Zero-rating; Net neutrality; Throttling; Traffic management; Mobile
   communications
ID NET NEUTRALITY; COMPETITION; INTERNET
AB We provide an economic assessment of zero-rating offers in the context of mobile internet access services and draw six lessons: (1) Zero-rating can have several different characteristics that crucially affect their economic and welfare assessment. Thus, regulatory interventions must be based on a careful case-by-case analysis. (2) In the context of zero-rating offers, it is often crucial to evaluate the extent to which users are able to activate and deactivate a (throttled) zero-rated tariff option. If activation/deactivation is easy and instantaneous, a sound economic theory of harm for consumers will in many cases be hard to establish. (3) Similarly, if access to zero-rated partner programs is non-discriminatory and entails low barriers to entry, a sound theory of harm for content providers will usually not be given. (4) Zero-rating can be beneficial for consumers and (legal) content providers alike by contributing to a reduction of illegal content. Combined with throttling it can mitigate congestion problems. However, by requiring all content belonging to the same content category to be treated equally with respect to throttling, independent of whether a content provider opted for zero-rating or not, the existing regulation creates a negative externality on those content providers that do not wish to be zero-rated for some reason. (5) Particular attention should be paid to the impact of throttled zero-rating tariffs on the competition between mobile network operators (MNOs) and MVNOs. The latter may not be able to compete on equal footing with MNOs, because they benefit less from the traffic management aspects of zero-rating. (6) Competition among (infrastructure-based) ISPs provides a safeguard against severe rent extraction and, thus, an abuse of throttling and zero-rating as an exploitative device. Therefore, regulators should carefully account for the competitive environment and the existing tariff portfolio and options before deciding to intervene. Competition policy, rather than ex-ante regulation, may be more suitable for this task.

   Health policy; Health workers; Volunteers; Ghana
ID INCENTIVES; MOTIVATION; GHANA; CARE
AB Background: Three-quarters of sub-Saharan Africa's urban population currently live under slum conditions making them susceptible to ill health and diseases. Ghana characterizes the situation in many developing countries where the urban poor have become a group much afflicted by complex health problems associated with their living conditions, and the intra-city inequity between them and the more privileged urban dwellers with respect to health care accessibility. Adopting Ghana's rural Community-Based Health Planning and Service (CHPS) programme in urban areas is challenging due to the differences in social networks and health challenges thus making modifications necessary. The Community Health Officers (CHOs) and their supervisors are the frontline providers of health in the community and there is a need to analyze and document the health sector response to urban CHPS.
   Methods: The study was solely qualitative and 19 in-depth interviews were conducted with all the CHOs and key health sector individuals in supervisory/coordinating positions working in urban CHPS zones to elicit relevant issues concerning urban CHPS implementation. Thematic content data analysis was done using the NVivo 7 software.
   Results: Findings from this appraisal suggest that the implementation of this urban concept of the CHPS programme has been well undertaken by the health personnel involved in the process despite the challenges that they face in executing their duties. Several issues came to light including the lack of first aid drugs, as well as the need for the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) programme and more indepth training for CHOs. In addition, the need to provide incentives for the volunteers and Community Health Committee members to sustain their motivation and the CHOs' apprehensions with regards to furthering their education and progression in their careers were key concerns raised.
   Conclusion: The establishment of the CHPS concept in the urban environment albeit challenging has been fraught with several opportunities to introduce innovations which tailor the rural milestones to meet urban needs. Modifications such as adjusting timing of home visits and renting accommodation in the communities for the CHOs have been beneficial to the programme.

AB BackgroundEnvironmental policies should be developed in a contextual decision-making process regarding local environmental concerns emphasizing the economic, technical, social and institutional considerations. Establishing emission limit levels, especially in the industrial sector, is one of the most problematic environmental issues in developing countries, for which it is essential to include several criteria that reflect their country-specific constraints and capacities. Since Best Available Technology (BAT) is acknowledged to be the reference element for sustainable development and a basis for Emissions Limit Values (ELVs), the objective of this study is to present a reliable methodology for establishing ELVs thresholds with an emphasis on the BAT concept for national regulation at the sector level.MethodsA hybrid fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) process, consisting of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) method, is structured to aggregate the different criteria and rank different ELV alternatives in this complicated evaluation. In order to use the most profound knowledge and judgment of a professional expert team, this qualitative assessment highlights the importance of supportive information.ResultsThe results obtained indicate that experts have considered the country-specific information as a reliable reference in their decisions. Among different key evaluation criteria in effluent standard setting, the highest experts' priority is Environmental protection. For both the conventional and toxic pollutants, the influence of all other criteria namely Economic feasibility, Technology viability and Institutional capacity, as constraining criteria in developing countries, have not reduced the responsibility towards the environmental objectives. In ELVs ranking, experts have made their decisions with respect to the specific characteristics of each pollutant and the existing capacities and constraints of the country, without emphasizing on any specific reference.ConclusionsThis systematic and transparent approach has resulted in defensible country-specific ELVs for the Iron and Steel industry, which can be developed for other sectors. As the main conclusion, this paper demonstrates that FMCDM is a robust tool for this comprehensive assessment especially regarding the data availability limitations in developing countries.

AB Objective: Local health departments (LHDs) have essential roles to play in ensuring the promotion of physical activity (PA) in their communities in order to reduce obesity. Little research exists, however, regarding the existence of these PA interventions across communities and how these interventions may impact community health.
   Design: In this exploratory study, we used cluster analysis to identify the structure of co-occurring PA interventions, followed by regression analysis to quantify the association between the patterns of PA interventions and prevalence of PA and obesity at a population level.
   Setting: Our study setting included local health jurisdictions in Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Washington.
   Participants: Participating jurisdictions were those 218 local health jurisdictions (mostly counties) from which LHD leaders had provided data in 2013 for the Multi-Network Practice and Outcome Variation Examination Study.
   Main Outcome Measures: We obtained unique public health activities data on PA interventions conducted in 2012 from 218 LHDs in 6 participating states. We categorized jurisdictions using cluster analysis, based on PA intervention approaches indicated by LHD leaders as available in their communities and then examined associations between categories and prevalence of obesity and of residents engaged in PA.
   Results: We identified 5 distinct PA intervention categories representing community-wide approachesComprehensive Approach, Built Environment, Personal Health, School-Based Interventions, and No Apparent Activities. Prevalence rates of obesity and PA among jurisdictions in the intervention clusters were significantly different from jurisdictions with No Apparent Activities, with more population-level approaches most significantly related to beneficial outcomes.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest the importance of standardized public health services data for generating evidence regarding health-related outcomes. The intervention categories we identified appear to reflect broad, local community-wide prevention approaches and demonstrated that population-level PA interventions can be testable and may have particularly beneficial relationships to community health. Widespread adoption of such standardized data depicting local public health prevention activity could support monitoring practice change, performance improvement, comparisons across communities that could reduce unnecessary variation, and the generation of evidence for public health practice and policy-making.

TI Extreme sea level implications of 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 2.5

AB Sea-level rise (SLR) is magnifying the frequency and severity of extreme sea levels (ESLs) that can cause coastal flooding. The rate and amount of global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise is a function of the trajectory of global mean surface temperature (GMST). Therefore, temperature stabilization targets (e.g. 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C of warming above pre-industrial levels, as from the Paris Agreement) have important implications for coastal flood risk. Here, we assess, in a global network of tide gauges, the differences in the expected frequencies of ESLs between scenarios that stabilize GMST warming at 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 2.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. We employ probabilistic, localized SLR projections and long-term hourly tide gauge records to estimate the expected frequencies of historical and future ESLs for the 21st and 22nd centuries. By 2100, under 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 2.5 degrees C-GMST stabilization, the median GMSL is projected to rise 48 cm (90% probability of 28-82 cm), 56 cm (28-96 cm), and 58 cm(37-93 cm), respectively. As an independent comparison, a semi-empirical sea level model calibrated to temperature and GMSL over the past two millennia estimates median GMSL rise within 7-8 cm of these projections. By 2150, relative to the 2.0 degrees C scenario and based on median sea level projections, GMST stabilization of 1.5 degrees C spares the inundation of lands currently home to about 5 million people, including 60 000 individuals currently residing in Small Island Developing States. We quantify projected changes to the expected frequency of historical 10-, 100-, and 500-year ESL events using frequency amplification factors that incorporate uncertainty in both local SLR and historical return periods of ESLs. By 2150, relative to a 2.0 degrees C scenario, the reduction in the frequency amplification of the historical 100 year ESL event arising from a 1.5 degrees C GMST stabilization is greatest in the eastern United States, with ESL event frequency amplification being reduced by about half at most tide gauges. In general, smaller reductions are projected for Small Island Developing States.

AB Introduction
   South Africa is moving into a new era of HIV treatment with treat all policies where people may be on treatment for most of their lives. We need to understand treatment outcomes and facilitators of long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and retention-in-care in the South African context. In one of the first studies to investigate long-term treatment outcomes in South Africa, we aimed to describe ten-year patient outcomes at a large public-sector HIV clinic in Johannesburg and explore patient experiences of the treatment programme over this time in order to ascertain factors that may aid or hinder long-term adherence and retention.
   MethodsResultsWe conducted a cohort analysis (n=6644) and in-depth interviews (n=24) among HIV-positive adults initiating first-line ART between April 2004 and March 2007. Using clinical records, we ascertained twelve-month and ten-year all-cause mortality and loss to follow-up (LTF). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify baseline predictors of attrition (mortality and LTF (>3months late for the last scheduled visit)) at twelvemonths and ten years. Twenty-four patients were purposively selected and interviewed to explore treatment programme experiences over ten years on ART.
   Excluding transfers, 79.5% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 78.5 to 80.5) of the cohort were alive, in care at twelvemonths dropping to 35.1% (95% CI: 33.7 to 36.4) at ten years. Over 44% of deaths occurred within 12months. Ten-year all-cause mortality increased, while LTF decreased slightly, with age. Year and age at ART initiation, sex, nationality, baseline CD4 count, anaemia, body mass index and initiating regimen were predictors of ten-year attrition. Among patients interviewed, the pretreatment clinic environment, feelings of gratitude and good fortune, support networks, and self-efficacy were facilitators of care; side effects, travel and worsening clinical conditions were barriers. Participants were generally optimistic about their futures and were committed to continued care.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the complexities of long-term chronic HIV treatment with declining all-cause mortality and increasing LTF over ten years. Barriers to long-term retention still present a significant challenge. As more people become eligible for ART in South Africa under treatment for all, new healthcare delivery challenges will arise; interventions are needed to ensure long-term programme successes continue.

AB Background: Many low- and middle-income countries are facing a double burden of disease with persisting high levels of infectious disease, and an increasing prevalence of non-communicable disease (NCD). Within these settings, complex processes and transitions concerning health and population are underway, altering population dynamics and patterns of disease. Understanding the mechanisms through which changing socioeconomic and environmental contexts may influence health is central to developing appropriate public health policy. Migration, which involves a change in environment and health exposure, is one such mechanism.
   Methods: This study uses Competing Risk Models to examine the relationship between internal migration and premature mortality from AIDS/TB and NCDs. The analysis employs 9 to 14 years of longitudinal data from four Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) of the INDEPTH Network located in Kenya and South Africa (populations ranging from 71 to 223 thousand). The study tests whether the mortality of migrants converges to that of non-migrants over the period of observation, controlling for age, sex and education level.
   Results: In all four HDSS, AIDS/TB has a strong influence on overall deaths. However, in all sites the probability of premature death (45q15) due to AIDS/TB is declining in recent periods, having exceeded 0.39 in the South African sites and 0.18 in the Kenyan sites in earlier years. In general, the migration effect presents similar patterns in relation to both AIDS/TB and NCD mortality, and shows a migrant mortality disadvantage with no convergence between migrants and non-migrants over the period of observation. Return migrants to the Agincourt HDSS (South Africa) are on average four times more likely to die of AIDS/TB or NCDs than are non-migrants. In the Africa Health Research Institute (South Africa) female return migrants have approximately twice the risk of dying from AIDS/TB from the year 2004 onwards, while there is a divergence to higher AIDS/TB mortality risk amongst female migrants to the Nairobi HDSS from 2010.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that structural socioeconomic issues, rather than epidemic dynamics are likely to be associated with differences in mortality risk by migrant status. Interventions aimed at improving recent migrant's access to treatment may mitigate risk.

AB Background: While the US population overall has experienced improvements in oral health over the past 60 years, oral diseases remain among the most common chronic conditions across the life course. Further, lack of access to oral health care contributes to profound and enduring oral health inequities worldwide. Vulnerable and underserved populations who commonly lack access to oral health care include racial/ethnic minority older adults living in urban environments. The aim of this study was to use a systematic approach to explicate cause and effect relationships in creating a causal map, a type of concept map in which the links between nodes represent causality or influence.
   Methods: To improve our mental models of the real world and devise strategies to promote oral health equity, methods including system dynamics, agent-based modeling, geographic information science, and social network simulation have been leveraged by the research team. The practice of systems science modeling is situated amidst an ongoing modeling process of observing the real world, formulating mental models of how it works, setting decision rules to guide behavior, and from these heuristics, making decisions that in turn affect the state of the real world. Qualitative data were obtained from focus groups conducted with community-dwelling older adults who self-identify as African American, Dominican, or Puerto Rican to elicit their lived experiences in accessing oral health care in their northern Manhattan neighborhoods.
   Results: The findings of this study support the multi-dimensional and multi-level perspective of access to oral health care and affirm a theorized discrepancy in fit between available dental providers and patients. The lack of information about oral health at the community level may be compromising the use and quality of oral health care among racial/ethnic minority older adults.
   Conclusions: Well-informed community members may fill critical roles in oral health promotion, as they are viewed as highly credible sources of information and recommendations for dental providers. The next phase of this research will involve incorporating the knowledge gained from this study into simulation models that will be used to explore alternative paths toward improving oral health and health care for racial/ethnic minority older adults.

AB This study uses multi-model ensemble results of 11 models from the second phase of Task Force Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP II) to calculate the global sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition in 2010. Modeled wet deposition is evaluated with observation networks in North America, Europe and East Asia. The modeled results agree well with observations, with 76-83% of stations being predicted within +/- 50% of observations. The models underestimate SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ wet depositions in some European and East Asian stations but overestimate NO3- wet deposition in the eastern United States. Intercomparison with previous projects (PhotoComp, ACCMIP and HTAP I) shows that HTPA II has considerably improved the estimation of deposition at European and East Asian stations. Modeled dry deposition is generally higher than the "inferential" data calculated by observed concentration and modeled velocity in North America, but the inferential data have high uncertainty, too. The global S deposition is 84 Tg(S) in 2010, with 49% in continental regions and 51% in the ocean (19% of which coastal). The global N deposition consists of 59 Tg(N) oxi-dized nitrogen (NOy) deposition and 64 Tg(N) reduced nitrogen (NHx) deposition in 2010. About 65% of N is deposited in continental regions, and 35% in the ocean (15% of which coastal). The estimated outflow of pollution from land to ocean is about 4 Tg(S) for S deposition and 18 Tg(N) for N deposition. Comparing our results to the results in 2001 from HTAP I, we find that the global distributions of S and N deposition have changed considerably during the last 10 years. The global S deposition decreases 2 Tg(S) (3 %) from 2001 to 2010, with significant decreases in Europe (5 Tg(S) and 55 %), North America (3 Tg(S) and 29 %) and Russia (2 Tg(S) and 26 %), and increases in South Asia (2 Tg(S) and 42 %) and the Middle East (1 Tg(S) and 44 %). The global N deposition increases by 7 Tg(N) (6 %), mainly contributed by South Asia (5 Tg(N) and 39 %), East Asia (4 Tg(N) and 21 %) and Southeast Asia (2 Tg(N) and 21 %). The NHx deposition increases with no control policy on NH3 emission in North America. On the other hand, NOy deposition has started to dominate in East Asia (especially China) due to boosted NOx emission.

TI Exploring Factors Affecting Voluntary Adoption of Electronic Medical
   Records Among Physicians and Clinical Assistants of Small or Solo
   Private General Practice Clinics
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS

AB The health care reform initiative led by the Hong Kong government's Food and Health Bureau has started the implementation of an electronic sharing platform to provide an information infrastructure that enables public hospitals and private clinics to share their electronic medical records (EMRs) for improved access to patients' health care information. However, previous attempts to convince the private clinics to adopt EMRs to document health information have faced challenges, as the EMR adoption has been voluntary. The lack of electronic data shared by private clinics carries direct impacts to the efficacy of electronic record sharing between public and private healthcare providers. To increase the likelihood of buy-in, it is essential to proactively identify the users' and organizations' needs and capabilities before large-scale implementation. As part of the reform initiative, this study examined factors affecting the adoption of EMRs in small or solo private general practice clinics, by analyzing the experiences and opinions of the physicians and clinical assistants during the pilot implementation of the technology, with the purpose to learn from it before full-scale rollout. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with 23 physicians and clinical assistants from seven small or solo private general practice clinics to evaluate their experiences, expectations, and opinions regarding the deployment of EMRs. Interview transcripts were content analyzed to identify key factors. Factors affecting the adoption of EMRs to record and manage health care information were identified as follows: system interface design; system functions; stability and reliability of hardware, software, and computing networks; financial and time costs; task and outcome performance, work practice, and clinical workflow; physical space in clinics; trust in technology; users' information technology literacy; training and technical support; and social and organizational influences. The factors are interrelated with the others. The adoption factors identified are multifaceted, ranging from technological characteristics, clinician-technology interactions, skills and knowledge, and the user-workflow-technology fit. Other findings, which have been relatively underrepresented in previous studies, contribute unique insights about the influence of work and social environment on the adoption of EMRs, including limited clinic space and the effects of physicians' decision to use the technology on clinical staffs' adoption decisions. Potential strategies to address the concerns, overcome adoption barriers, and define relevant policies are discussed.

AB Background: Descriptive norms (what other people do) relate to individual-level dietary behaviour and health outcome including overweight and obesity. Descriptive norms vary across residential areas but the impact of spatial variation in norms on individual-level diet and health is poorly understood. This study assessed spatial associations between local descriptive norms for overweight/obesity and insufficient fruit intake (spatially-specific local prevalence), and individual-level dietary intakes (fruit, vegetable and sugary drinks) and 10-year change in body mass index (BMI) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c).
   Methods: HbA1c and BMI were clinically measured three times over 10 years for a population-based adult cohort (n = 4056) in Adelaide, South Australia. Local descriptive norms for both overweight/obesity and insufficient fruit intake specific to each cohort participant were calculated as the prevalence of these factors, constructed from geocoded population surveillance data aggregated for 1600 m road-network buffers centred on cohort participants' residential addresses. Latent growth models estimated the effect of local descriptive norms on dietary behaviours and change in HbA1c and BMI, accounting for spatial clustering and covariates (individual-level age, sex, smoking status, employment and education, and area-level median household income).
   Results: Local descriptive overweight/obesity norms were associated with individual-level fruit intake (inversely) and sugary drink consumption (positively), and worsening HbA1c and BMI. Spatially-specific local norms for insufficient fruit intake were associated with individual-level fruit intake (inversely) and sugary drink consumption (positively) and worsening HbA1c but not change in BMI. Individual-level fruit and vegetable intakes were not associated with change in HbA1c or BMI. Sugary drink consumption was also not associated with change in HbA1c but rather with increasing BMI.
   Conclusion: Adverse local descriptive norms for overweight/obesity and insufficient fruit intake are associated with unhealthful dietary intakes and worsening HbA1c and BMI. As such, spatial variation in lifestyle-related norms is an important consideration relevant to the design of population health interventions. Adverse local norms influence health behaviours and outcomes and stand to inhibit the effectiveness of traditional intervention efforts not spatially tailored to local population characteristics. Spatially targeted social de-normalisation strategies for regions with high levels of unhealthful norms may hold promise in concert with individual, environmental and policy intervention approaches.

AB In the recent years, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road have been rapidly increasing. Charging this increasing number of EVs is expected to have an impact on the electricity grid especially if high charging powers and opportunistic charging are used. Several models have been proposed to quantify this impact. Multiple papers have observed that the charging stations are used by multiple users during the day. However, this observation was not assumed in any previous model. Moreover, none of the previous models relied on geospatial maps to extract information about the parking lots where charging stations are installed and the charging profiles of the potential users of these charging stations.
   In this paper, a spatial Markov chain model is developed to model the charging load of EVs in cities. The model assumes three distinct charging profiles: Work, Home, and Other. Geospatial maps were used to estimate the charging profile, or mixture of profiles, of the charging stations based on the nearby building types.
   A case study was made on the city of Uppsala, Sweden a city with approximately 44,000 cars. The results of the case study indicated that the aggregate load of the EVs in the city reduced the charging impact. For example when using 22 kW chargers, the peak load in the city per EV was estimated to be 1.29 kW/car in case of spatio-temporally opportunistic charging, and 1.47 kW/car in case of residential only opportunistic charging. This is to say that the Swedish grid operators can expect that every EV in the city will increase the peak load by at most 1.47 kW due to aggregation; this is assuming that 22 kW chargers were used.
   In addition, we showed that the minute-minute variability of the charging load in cities might cause some future challenges. In our case, up to 3% of the EVs in the city simultaneously started charging. This caused a one minute-ramp in the charging load of 1.1 MW-if charging using 3.7 kW. Charging with higher powers will exacerbate these ramps, e.g., charging with 22 kW will cause sudden one-minute-increases as high as 6.7 MW in the charging load. Such a finding indicates that using high charging powers might cause high variability in the charging load of EVs in cities. This high variability might limit the synergy potentials between EVs and variable renewable energy sources (RES).
   The proposed model can potentially be used along with RES models to estimate the spatio-temporal synergy potentials between the two technologies. Evaluating the synergy potentials might be of value to grid operators, policy makers, market traders, etc.

AB Background: Regional variations in reperfusion times and mortality in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction are influenced by differences in coordinating care between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals. Building on the Accelerator-1 Project, we hypothesized that time to reperfusion could be further reduced with enhanced regional efforts.
   Methods: Between April 2015 and March 2017, we worked with 12 metropolitan regions across the United States with 132 percutaneous coronary intervention-capable hospitals and 946 EMS agencies. Data were collected in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network)-Get With The Guidelines Registry for quarterly Mission: Lifeline reports. The primary end point was the change in the proportion of EMS-transported patients with first medical contact to device time 90 minutes from baseline to final quarter. We also compared treatment times and mortality with patients treated in hospitals not participating in the project during the corresponding time period.
   Results: During the study period, 10730 patients were transported to percutaneous coronary intervention-capable hospitals, including 974 in the baseline quarter and 972 in the final quarter who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 61 years; 27% were women, 6% had cardiac arrest, and 6% had shock on admission; 10% were black, 12% were Latino, and 10% were uninsured. By the end of the intervention, all process measures reflecting coordination between EMS and hospitals had improved, including the proportion of patients with a first medical contact to device time of 90 minutes (67%-74%; P<0.002), a first medical contact to device time to catheterization laboratory activation of 20 minutes (38%-56%; P<0.0001), and emergency department dwell time of 20 minutes (33%-43%; P<0.0001). Of the 12 regions, 9 regions reduced first medical contact to device time, and 8 met or exceeded the national goal of 75% of patients treated in 90 minutes. Improvements in treatment times corresponded with a significant reduction in mortality (in-hospital death, 4.4%-2.3%; P=0.001) that was not apparent in hospitals not participating in the project during the same time period.
   Conclusions: Organization of care among EMS and hospitals in 12 regions was associated with significant reductions in time to reperfusion in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction as well as in in-hospital mortality. These findings support a more intensive regional approach to emergency care for patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.

AB IMPORTANCE Diversifying the health care workforce remains a critical goal for health care organizations focused on reducing disparities in care. However, it remains unknown what factors create inclusive health system environments and help organizations retain a diverse workforce.
   OBJECTIVE To understand from members of the health care workforce what factors contribute to inclusive work and learning environments and what can be done to improve inclusion within health care organizations.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A qualitative narrative analysis of responses to a weekly email call for narratives within health care organizations sent June 1, 8, 15, and 22, 2016. The email contained an anonymous link to 2 open-ended stimulus questions asking for stories reflecting inclusion or lack thereof within participants' work environments as well as demographic questions. The study took place at 6 hospitals, including a free-standing children's hospital and a Veterans Affairs medical center, 4 health sciences schools (Medicine, Nursing, Dental, and Social Policy and Practice), and outpatient facilities within a university-based health care system in Pennsylvania. There were 315 completed narratives submitted from health care system executives (n = 3), staff (n = 113), academic faculty (n = 97), trainees or students (n = 99), and 3 who declined to specify their positions.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Workplace experiences with inclusivity, implications of these experiences, and recommendations to improve inclusion within environments.
   RESULTS Of 315 narratives submitted from members of the health care system, in 188 (59.7%)the writer self-identified as female; in 10 (3.2%). as transgender/queer; in 38 (12.1%), as non-Hispanic black; in 152 (48.3%), as non-Christian; in 31(9.8%), as having a language other than English as their primary language; and in 14 (4.4%), as having a disability. Analysis of the narratives revealed 6 broad factors that affected inclusion within health care organizations: (1) the presence of discrimination; (2) the silent witness; (3) the interplay of hierarchy, recognition, and civility; (4) the effectiveness of organizational leadership and mentors; (5) support for work-life balance; and (6) perceptions of exclusion from inclusion efforts. Challenges with inclusion had negative effects on job performance and well-being, with reports of stress, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness. Most respondents referenced a systemic culture that influenced their interpersonal dynamics and provided specific strategies to improve organizational culture that focused on leadership training and expanding collegial networks.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This narrative analysis provides a taxonomy of factors that health care organizations can use to assess inclusion within their learning and work environments as well as strategies to improve inclusion and retain a diverse health care workforce.

AB But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics. For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be called an 'applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice. A contrasting 'relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency, interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful. It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice. I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand, care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.
   I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention, attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould observes concerning solidarity on this score: 'the proliferation of solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences, along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret Urban Walker has called the 'expressive-collaborative' model of morality over the 'theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power. Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness and embodied living in the natural, material world.
   Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going, contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning this contest, we should 'see the process as basic and never ending, and [subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than [imagine] that it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However, when these patterns endure they comprise 'practices', which may be defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this definition more fully. First, social practices are structured sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power, distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value. Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped, and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact together.
   A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually constructed or 'theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at 'the root of the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of what has been called 'interpretive phenomenology' and has been well developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change, transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal ellipsis The ethos embedded in [interpretive] phenomenology is respect for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices, skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices allow for the other to be encountered and made visible.
   When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it, this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism, reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive, discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty. The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a critique of what she calls 'conventional solidarity', and defines a counter-notion of 'reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. 'Conscience just isn't enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role in them,' he writes. 'Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that could secure moral results that challenge one's standing.
   ' Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all. Thus Kolers defines solidarity as 'reason-driven political action on other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction between agency and the institutional structures within which agency takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and practices of community, but who crucially brings community and solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what might be called 'comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy, one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members.
   In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense, two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity between its members. 'Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time. It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting, defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; it makes perfect sense to talk about being in solidarity with friends and acquaintances. Moreover, the other need not be a human individual: one can stand up for other species, an ecosystem, or a cultural way of life. What is crucial is that there is some kind of power or knowledge differential between self and other in a relationship of solidarity and some kind of injustice or danger impinging upon the life of the other. This kind of solidarity can advocate for improved treatment or benefits for an oppressed or vulnerable group, but does not necessarily challenge the underlying basis for their subordinate social status. Yet, if it does not undermine structural inequalities, standing up for solidarity can perpetuate subordination rather than achieve equality.Standing up with. Solidarity as standing up with takes another step in the recognition of moral standing. Moving from the standpoint for to the standpoint with requires deeper engagement with the experience and lifeworld of the other.
   The difference created by the specificity of lifeworlds nonetheless resides within an overarching interpretive commonality, namely, the ability to understand lifeworlds other than one's own. Without such understanding, others cannot truly be treated with respect, they can only be tolerated, benignly neglected, not interfered with. This closer understanding can tend to humanize and personalize the relationship further, and the potential benefit becomes more reciprocal. Those who stand with others may find their own initial prejudgments concerning others transformed by the encounter. Those who practice solidarity must open themselves to the opportunity-and risk-it poses. Relating to other people or groups in the specificity of their values and vocabularies of self-interpretation can simultaneously develop respect for the specific standpoints of others. It can also enable a greater capacity for intercultural and transpersonal interpretive understanding broadly within a democratic political culture and way of life.Standing up as. The third standpoint is solidarity as standing up as. Obviously this suggests a yet stronger degree of identification between the providers of solidaristic support and the recipients of such support. The solidarity of standing up as involves finding a kind of covering connection that does not negate diversity among individuals at all, but rather establishes the grounds of its respect, protection, and perpetuation. To move through the trajectory of solidarity is to move in the direction of greater imaginative creativity and range in the moral life. Standing up for depends upon a kind of abstract moral commitment to support the application of general norms to the life situation of the other as a being with a certain inherent moral status. It thereby embraces shared moral norms (equal protection of the law, universal human rights), but without necessarily embracing the lived reality and distinct perspectives of the other. Standing up with involves adopting a perspective that is more internal to the lifeworld and the contextually meaningful agency of the other. Standing up as returns to generality, in the sense of a recognition of common humanity, a global or planetary membership, but also moves one imaginatively more deeply into a comprehension of difference and the distinctive individuality of the other. As the moral recognition of the other is altered by this interpretive journey, so is the moral imagination of the self. Arguably a growth in one's capacity to project oneself imaginatively into the perspective and viewpoint of the other person, and a growth in moral awareness or the ability to see connections previously unseen are plausible outcomes of the interpretive transformation effected by the trajectory of solidarity. The practices of solidarity mainly arise in the face of morally aberrant and unjust situations that are stifling human potential and where those being oppressed or suppressed need mobilized support and recognition. What the recipients of solidarity need, and the agents of solidarity provide, is affirmation and tangible support. In contrast, what the recipients of care need, and the agents of care provide, is attention. Though closely related and mutually reinforcing in many ways, solidarity and care are not the same, as affirmation and attention are different stances with different moral significance and developmental potentials. The practices of care are premised on situations that are neither aberrant nor unjust per se but are an inherent part of human species-being.
   Like solidarity, care also deepens the moral imagination of both those who care for others and those who are cared for by others. If focusing on solidarity shifts away from individualism and independence toward mutuality and interdependence, focusing on care shifts away from the individualism of self-reliance to an individuality validated by reliance on others. The practices of care are called forth where a common background condition of potential fragility, vulnerability, insufficiency, and mortality take center stage in the lives of persons in need or trouble and in the lives of those around them. Care offers a universalism that is concrete and thick. It is quite possible to imagine (and to find close empirical approximations of) societies where solidarity is absent. Not so with care. Even the subjugated and impoverished society of the Ik so strikingly (and controversially) described by Colin Turnbull, retained ways of caring for their very young, if not for their very old. They almost, but not quite, lost their cultural concept of care. Care theorists, such as Eva Feder Kittay, point out that universalism is biologically grounded on the necessity of maternal care. Every living human being has in common the fact that once they were cared for by someone (female or male) who took on a mothering role and relationship with them. This commonality extends backward in time. All persons who cared as a mother for a child were able to do so only because mothering had been extended to them by a previous generation. Human society fundamentally depends on the production and reproduction of this structure of care-giving roles and relationships. Equality, Kittay argues, is not based on properties that an individual possesses by virtue of who that individual is, but instead on properties that one possesses by virtue of properties that another person has or once had. In keeping with this, care theorist Joan Tronto also views care as a concrete universal, or a 'species activity' and has proposed that caring: includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our 'world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. This provides yet another reason to distinguish between solidarity and care. Solidarity is based on who the other is as an individual human being and on 'properties' they possess, if by properties we mean something like their moral standing and considerability, their entitlement to dignity and to respect for their human rights. When it comes to care, however, we are dealing not so much with recognition due to persons as with the ongoing, intergenerational, evolutionary web of living that all practices of care at any given moment are a part of. Solidarity is a response that unjustly denied recognition and moral standing calls for. Caring is a response that need calls forth, drawing on cognitive commitments and emotional capabilities that previous practices of caring have made possible. Care, like all the practices that relational bioethics examines and evaluates, should not be defined as good or just in all circumstances and in all its forms. The important work of ethical specification and judgment is skipped over when we equate care with virtues such as agape (selfless love of the other) and caritas (charity), or with social emotions such as other-regarding altruism or sympathy.
   Thus it is important to ask what substantive values should inform caring as a moral practice and its effects. How best to describe the stance and intentionality of caring, its transformative moral psychological effects on agents of care and recipients, and its role in governing structural and institutional power so as to mitigate the tension between social order and social diversity? With these questions in mind, I turn again to construct a developmental moral phenomenology of the practice of care. Before presenting my own account, I should note that Tronto has already offered something akin to what I have in mind. She distinguishes among caring about, taking care of, care giving, and care receiving. Caring about denotes the initial recognition of another's need for care. Taking care of involves assuming responsibility for the determined need of the other and undertaking steps to meet that need. Care giving involves assuming a more direct, physical, and intimate role in the practices of care. Need can be recognized and attended to in many distanced and indirect ways, but giving care is hands-on, physical work. It signifies a new level of commitment and engagement than the other forms the activity of care can take. Finally, care receiving as a distinct component of the practice of care recognizes that the recipient will often be a responsive agent in the care relationship. These distinctions are helpful, particularly in the context of Tronto's concern with the ethically and democratically appropriate institutionalization of the practices of care in a society as a whole. I seek, on the other hand, to explore a structured growth of moral awareness that may be illuminating to ascribe to the praxis of care, as I have tried to do with solidarity. The fundamental stance of the practice of care is to pay attention to. Just as right recognition of personhood and moral standing is fundamental to the solidaristic posture of standing up beside, so too the directed gaze of attention is fundamental to the posture of care. When someone, a student or a distracted friend during a conversation, is called upon to pay attention, their focus shifts and even their bodily orientation may change: they open their eyes, they listen actively, they lean in. Right recognition here comes from becoming visible to another as a sign of acknowledgment and respect. In some cultures and settings, paying attention to someone takes the form of making eye contact as a sign of such respect; in others, deliberately not making eye contact has the same significance. Both are gestures and postures of care. In this sense, the propensity to attend, to care, is not primarily biological or reflexive; it is a mode of culturally meaningful agency, it is a wink rather than a blink. Standing up beside the oppressed-and up against the oppressor-is a gesture that extracts 'payment' in the form of public witness, which can incur negative sanctions or give one an aura of virtue by association. Paying attention to is also not cost-free in terms of its effects on plans in one's life or on other persons, whom the practice of care displaces from one's attention. Solidarity sets priorities, care balances and reshuffles them. Finally, on this account of the moral phenomenology of care, the presence of physical or psychological limitation or impairment is not primarily what calls forth the duty to care, although it is often the trigger for an intensified focus of attention and the commencement of new caring relationships and services.
   The moral raison d'etre of paying attention to is the evil of invisibility, disregard, and abandonment. Willie Loman's wife, Linda, understood this in Death of a Salesman, when she called upon her son to care for his father. 'Attention must be paid.' She was not asking him to help Willie with his medications. The need for care is indeed universal, both biologically and culturally, because it responds to vulnerability, suffering, and mortality. However, being erased and deserted, reduced to bare self-reliance, having to fend for oneself alone-these conditions are neither universal nor inevitable. They are potentials in the human condition that the practice of care was morally and culturally invented to prevent, just as the practice of solidarity was invented to prevent the evil of misprision. And failure to prevent these evils not only diminishes the humanity of those who did not receive attention and recognition, but also diminishes those who failed to give them. There are three distinct postures that agents of care assume toward others in need. No doubt there are many more, but I want to single these out here. I shall call them attentive rehabilitation, attentive companionship, and attentive commitment. These moments in the practices of care are relational interactions between individuals or groups, with each side having voice (to the extent possible) and engaging in a give and take of initiative and response. However, as with my analysis of solidarity, this is presented primarily from the perspective of the agent of care rather than the other receiving care.Attentive rehabilitation of the other. To care is to take steps to rehabilitate or return the other in need to a situation of enhanced living or, as Tronto aptly puts it, repairing the other's world. If return to the status quo ante is impossible, rehabilitative attention becomes a project of helping to construct a new mode of life that will be meaningful and sustainable for the other, who will then go on to live with-and in spite of-social or physical limitations. This is the aspect of care that is perhaps closest to care giving and care provision in a professional sense. It is certainly based on respectful recognition of the moral standing of the patient, but its main hallmark is efficacy in the restoration of function. It is also the aspect of care that is closest in intention to solidarity, for the attention paid here is largely affirming, and the line I have tried to draw between affirmation and attention is blurred. But to probe more deeply into the dimensions of care that have to do with suffering and loss of self and meaning, we need to move beyond restoration and repair.Attentive companionship with and for the other. Companionship is an aspect of care that includes, but is not limited to, physically spending time together and direct communication, as humanly important as they are. Companionship, in the sense I am trying to get at, lays the groundwork for a developing sense of promise, presence, and assurance in the minds and hearts of both the agent of care and the other. Companionship recognizes the evil of abandonment and is one of the most powerful answering responses to this evil on behalf of the human good. It is difficult to say what concept best conveys the aspect of care that can provide this reassurance and abiding sense of connection between and among individuals and groups. Promise connotes perhaps too formal and legalistic a sense. Loyalty connotes something perhaps overly psychological.
   Friendship is tempting but again may suggest an affection or emotional bond that is stronger than I want to convey for this aspect of care.In any case, the reassurance of a promise of non-abandonment is what is built into this mode of attentiveness. Note that this reassurance applies, albeit differently, to both the agent and the recipient of care. My notion is that the suffering experienced by those with unmet needs for care takes place against an ever-present prospect of being left alone. Those young and well often ask to be left alone, not realizing truly what they are inviting, when what they actually want is more privacy and a less intrusive care presence. Caring as attentive companionship makes the grim prospect of abandonment recede in the other's imagination and hence palliates the suffering-often in the form of dread, anxiety, and loss of self-confidence and self-esteem-they experience.To move into a mode of attentive companionship in the care process is clearly a step beyond rehabilitation. What prompts such a step, or better, what is germinated by it? My answer is a new sense of gratitude in the moral imagination of the agent of care. It may be the gratitude felt for the newly arrived life of an infant, and the realization of how vital the assurance of non-abandonment will be to the developmental flourishing of the child. It may be intergenerational gratitude that is reciprocal, as when adult children alter their own lives and priorities to assure companionship to an ailing or lonely parent. It may be a sense of obligation or debt based on remembering the constructive activities of the other, which indirectly has been of significant social and individual benefit to the attentive companion. This is the case, for example, in care-providing institutions that serve military veterans, and this moral sensibility could indeed be extended to all, military and non-military alike, who have sacrificed for the sake of public service. Or it may be itself a form of solidarity at the heart of the practice of care, because it is based on recognition of the human value of rescuing a person from fear and despair to give them a better chance of flourishing in the future.Attentive commitment to the other. This represents a stronger and deeper sense of caring connection, in which the caring agent has internalized a stronger sense of duty and embraced a longer-term, and maybe more arduous, promise to the care recipient. However, the notion of care as attentive commitment to, precisely because it takes in a longer time horizon, can bring out the structural and public policy dimensions of the practice of care, as well. The fact is that individuals and private groups (like families) cannot actually sustain this modality of care without significant social, economic, and institutional support. Part of their commitment would be to work toward building systems of public provision for care services in their role as democratic citizens. Indeed, the politics of social insurance and long-term care policy in the United States would be altered if millions of unpaid family care givers could find the information, time, and energy to mobilize in favor of new financing and service delivery systems.
   To the extent that we want to develop an ecology of care-the creation of a cultural ethos and an institutional framework that promotes and supports practices of care not only in the household and family but also in the public sphere and the civil society-then we must link practices of care to forms of democratic political reform to make society more just, equitable, and conducive to health and well-being. Within the broader political economy and social welfare policy of a nation, paying attention in private life and in public policy-civic care-can reinforce one another. The practice of care can sometimes be imperious and domineering. And all too often caring becomes merely custodial. Yet, when it realizes its full moral promise, care offers nurture, protection, provision, and support for the other. It does not so much domineer as give the person receiving it a new insight about his or her own life. Since the need for care often follows injury, illness, and loss of various kinds, care offers hope through a new way of seeing the positive possibilities present in a given situation. It sustains purpose in the face of diminution. Care among humans is a transaction among individuals who are the authors of their own acts and lives, despite their need, impairment, or limitations. But they are symbiotic, not solipsistic, authors. Like solidarity, care is grounded in the gratitude felt when one recognizes the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life. And like the practice of solidarity, the practice of care interrupts an ongoing form of life in order to be present with another in the face of their need, vulnerability, and suffering, finally winning through to a life well lived. Solidarity and care can arise developmentally out of an engagement with the vocation of repairing a needful, vulnerable, responsive world. The author declares no conflict of interest. Miller, A.

The terminology related to care is more complex and varied, in English, than that related to solidarity. I have chosen to use the term 'care' rather than resort to terms such as caring, care giving, care providing, and the like. When conjoined with the concept of a practice, care should be understood always to connote a dynamic pattern of agency, intention, and action over time. For my purposes in this article, this pattern and its consequences are more important than specific acts performed within practices of care, such as direct physical assistance with activities of everyday living, psychological assistance, ensuring comfort and safety, and the like. Care is touching, but as John Dewey pointed out, it is also minding. See Boydston, J. A. (Ed.). (2008). Art as experience. In The Later Works of John Dewey, 1925-1953 (Vol. 10, p. 68).

   SOLIDARITY AND CARE SOLIDARITY THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF SOLIDARITY CARE THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF CARE CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Many working in bioethics today are engaging in forms of normative interpretation concerning the meaningful contexts of relational agency and institutional structures of power. Using the framework of relational bioethics, this article focuses on two significant social practices that are significant for health policy and public health: the practices of solidarity and the practices of care. The main argument is that the affirming recognition of, and caring attention paid to, persons as moral subjects can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. Solidarity is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from standing up for another, standing up with another, and standing up as another. Care is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from the attentive rehabilitation of another, attentive companionship with and for another, and attentive commitment to another.

AB INTRODUCTION
   Congenital anomalies (CAs) represent one of the main cause of foetal death, infant mortality and morbidity, and long-term disability. CAs have been object of systematic registration activity for a long-time in many geographical areas in Europe and worldwide. CAs are often associated with disabilities of different types and severity, including the developed Countries worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year approximately 3,2 million of children worldwide are born with a CA and approximately 300,000 newborns with a diagnosis of birth defect die within the first 28 days of life. In Europe, CAs are the leading cause of perinatal mortality: the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) network estimated a perinatal mortality associated with CAs of 9.2 per 10,000 births in 2008-2012. In Italy, the Ministry of Health estimates that, on the average of 500,000 births each year, about 25,000 present at least one CA. Moreover, approximately 25% of infant mortality is due to CAs and about 50% of infant mortality is attributable to perinatal morbidity, almost always of prenatal origin. Regarding long-term survival, a recent population study conducted between 1985 and 2003 in the UK estimated a 20.5-year survival of 85.5% of children born with at least one CA. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 3.3% of live births in the United States have a severe birth defect. Since CAs represent a significant public health issue, an effective primary prevention strategy should be a priority for public policies and healthcare system.
   Regarding aetiology, although in many cases the cause is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that CAs may be developed during the first trimester of pregnancy as a result of hereditary polygenic defects or of a gene-environment interaction. The aetiology is predominantly multifactorial, caused by complex interactions between genes and environment, which modify the normal embryo-foetal development, especially during the organogenesis phase.
   In particular, environmental factors (e.g., chemical toxicants, infection agents, maternal disease, and exogenous factors) can have preconceptional mutagenic action, postconceptional teratogenic effects, periconceptional endocrine disruption or epigenetic action. Regarding genetic causes, there are genetic-chromosomal aberrations or dysgeneses. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors affect reproductive health by differentiating the exposure to the other risk factors as well as the access to prevention measures.
   In recent years, the importance of the environment as a major factor of reproductive risk has been highlighted.
   An individual may be exposed to pollutants present in the workplace and the population may be exposed to multiple sources of environmental contamination of water, soil, and air matrices. Pregnant women and the developing foetus are particularly sensitive to the effects of environmental exposure.
   OBJECTIVE
   The aim of the present working paper is to produce an updated review of the epidemiological evidence on the risk of CAs associated with environmental exposures, socioeconomic, and main individual risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, according to the approach proposed by Pirastu et al. 2010 in the framework of the SENTIERI Project (the Italian Epidemiological Study of Residents in National Priority Contaminated Sites).
   DESIGN AND METHODS
   Literature search was carried out in PubMed, following the SENTIERI project criteria to evaluate evidence, by selecting articles in English or Italian language published from 2011 to 2016 regarding human studies. For this review, descriptive and analytical epidemiological studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, and ecological), systematic reviews, and metanalyses reporting association estimates between the outcome and at least one of the risk factors were selected.
   As in Pirastu et al., the sources of environmental exposure have been classified into four macrocategories: industries, mines, landfills, and incinerators. The sources of individual exposure considered were: active and passive cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, socioeconomic status (SES), occupational and environmental exposures related to air pollutants from vehicular traffic only. The obtained results were assessed according to the evaluation criteria on the epidemiological evidence related to the association between the outcome and exposures predefined and published by the SENTIERI working group (WG). For the evidence assessment, the SENTIERI WG criteria favoured firstly primary sources and quantitative metanalyses, secondly, consistency among sources. The evaluation of the epidemiological evidence for the association between outcome and the exposure has been classified into three categories: sufficient (S), limited (L), inadequate (I).
   RESULTS
   Industries: during the period under review, six single studies evaluating the association between industrial sites exposure and the risk of CAs were found. The epidemiological evidence of association between outcome and exposure has been considered limited. Mines: from the bibliographic research, three single studies investigating possible cause-effect relationship between maternal residential proximity to mines and the risk of CAs have been collected providing inadequate epidemiological evidence.
   Landfills: during the period under review, one systematic review and one literature review evaluating the causal associations between maternal residential proximity to landfills and CAs were identified. The epidemiological evidence is limited and concerns almost exclusively sites containing industrial or hazardous waste.
   Incinerators: a systematic review has been selected; it concludes that the evidence for the association between maternal residential proximity to incinerators and CAs are inadequate.
   Cigarette smoking: the literature search identified eight systematic reviews with metanalysis, five multicentre studies, and ten single studies assessing the causal association between maternal and/or paternal exposure to smoking and the risk of CAs in the offspring providing sufficient evidence for a causal association between maternal exposure to cigarette smoke and the risk of congenital heart defects, oro-facial clefts, neural tube defects, and gastrointestinal malformations.
   Alcohol: three systematic reviews with metanalysis, two metanalyses, one multicentre study, and four single studies were collected for the period under review. The acquired literature has provided limited epidemiological evidence for associations between alcohol consumption and CAs in the nervous system, particularly for anencephaly and spina bifida.
   Socioeconomic status: the evidence of an association with socioeconomic factors was inadequate due to an insufficient number of studies selected during the period under consideration.
   Occupational exposure: the literature search collected one metanalysis, eight multicentre studies, and five single studies. The epidemiological evidence for associations between paternal occupational exposure to solvents and neural tube defects and between maternal pesticide exposure and gold-facial clefts were judged limited.
   Air pollution: two systematic reviews with metanalyses, two multicentre studies, and nine single studies were selected by literature search; the epidemiological evidence for a causal association between air pollutants exposure and the risk of CAs is still to be considered limited.
   CONCLUSIONS
   For future epidemiological studies, a better exposure assessment, using in particular more accurate spatial measurements or models, a standardized case definition, a larger sample and more accurate control of the recognized or presumed confounding variables are needed.

TI Neglected Issues: How Charter Schools Manage Teachers and Acquire

SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD

DT Article

AB Background/Context: Charter schools are commonly discussed as being more effective at matching student and family interests with school mission, ensuring family choice of educational products and improving education quality and the efficiency of resource use as a result of the competitive dynamics they are assumed to generate between themselves and public schools. The rhetoric around charter schools in general puts little attention on teacher management and resource acquisition, and the literature on charter schools has tended to focus on outcomes such as student achievement. The prevalence of charter schools within and outside the United States underscores the need to understand what role such issues as teacher management and resourcing play in this increasingly popular education reform.
   Focus of Study: The purpose of this article is to uncover and present the strategies that charter schools employ for managing teachers and acquiring resources, and with what implications.
   Research Design: Through a qualitative case study of a charter school program in Bogota, Colombia, that began in 1999, we investigated (a) the regulations that governed the hiring firing. and compensation of charter school teachers,, in addition to (b) how charters respond to those regulations in contracting teachers, and (c) the overall approach of charter principals and the charter management organizations (CMOs) that oversee them when it comes to teacher engagement. collaboration, supervision, and professional development. In terms of resource acquisition, the focus was on understanding (d) the extent of government provided resources to charter schools, (e) the perceptions of charter principals and CMO directors of the resources provided by the government. (f) the ways in which these actors have sought to complement these resources, and (g) the kinds of additional resources that have been obtained. Data in the form of documents, archives, literature and evaluations, and qualitative interviews were collected over eight months.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that charter school teachers in Bogota feel that many aspects of their work environment are positive, though they also report tradeoffs in terms of job security and financial compensation. Charter schools use the flexibility afforded to them around employment to spend half as much on teachers by hiring nonunionized teachers, contracting them for periods of a year or less, assigning teachers to lower compensation categories, and offering significantly lower salaries, despite teachers working over 12 hours more each week than their public school counterparts. Findings with regard to resource acquisition address differences between public and charter schools, perceptions of school leaders, and the routes to resource acquisition used by charter schools, namely budget prioritization, donations, volunteers, partnerships, and alumni networks. Implications for future research are discussed, including the need for studies to distinguish among types of charter schools. The article concludes that, when addressing the costs and benefits of charter schools, we need to ask: Costs in what sense? Benefits for whom? And at whose expense?

AB Autonomy and autonomous systems are occupying central stage in the research community, as autonomous vehicles are proliferating and their utility in all aspects of the military and civilian domains are increasing exponentially from one year to the next. The development and application of resiliency and safety technologies to autonomous systems is, unfortunately, not keeping pace with their growth rate. Several factors impede the deployment and adoption of autonomous systems. Among them is the absence of an adequately high level of autonomy that can be relied upon, significant challenges in the area of human-machine interface requiring significant human intervention to operate and interpret sensor data, the need for emerging machine learning technologies and, most importantly, the resilient design and operation of complex systems to assure their safety, reliability and availability when executing missions in unstructured and cluttered environments. Recent advances in resiliency and safety of complex engineered systems have focused on methods/tools to tradeoff system performance for increased time to failure aiming at mission completion or trial and error methods to arrive at a suboptimal policy for system self-organization in the presence of a failure mode. This paper introduces a novel framework for the resilient design and operation of such complex systems via self-organization and control reconfiguration strategies that avoid empirical trial and error techniques and may be implemented and perform in real time on-platform. The main theme is summarized as: "a healthy and resilient system is a safe system". To accomplish this objective, we introduce an integrated and rigorous approach to resilient design while safety considerations ascertain that the targeted system is contained within a safe envelope. A resilient system is robustly and flexibly monitoring its internal and external environment, it can detect and anticipate disturbances that may affect its operational integrity and take appropriate action to compensate for the disturbance. Resilience enhances safety while improving risk factors and assures that vehicles subjected to extreme disturbances remain within their safe envelope. The enabling technologies begin with graph spectral and epidemic spreading modeling tools to represent the system behaviors under normal and faulty conditions; a Markov Decision Process is the basic self-organization module. We are introducing a novel approach to fault-tolerance by considering the impacts of severe fault modes on system performance as inputs to a Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy that trades off system performance with control activity in order to extend the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the unmanned system. Performance metrics are defined and assist in the algorithmic developments and their validation. We pursue an integrated and verifiable methodology to safety assurance that enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Several unmanned autonomous systems are used for demonstration purposes.

AB The main objectives of this study were (1) investigation of the temporal variations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground level ozone (O-3) concentrations in Tehran megacity, the capital and most populous city in Iran, over a 10-year period from 2006 to 2015, and (2) estimation of their long-term health effects including all-cause and cause-specific mortality. For the first goal, the data of PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations, measured at 21 regulatory monitoring network stations in Tehran, were obtained and the temporal trends were investigated. The health impact assessment of PM2.5 and O-3 was performed using the World Health Organization (WHO) AirQ+ software updated in 2016 by WHO European Centre for Environment and Health. Local baseline incidences in Tehran level were used to better reveal the health effects associated with PM2.5 and O-3. Our study showed that over 2006-2015, annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 and O-3 varied from 24.7 to 38.8 mu g m(-3) and 35.4 to 76.0 mu g m(-3), respectively, and were significantly declining in the recent 6 years (2010-2015) for PM2.5 and 8 years (2008-2015) for O-3. However, Tehran citizens were exposed to concentrations of annual PM2.5 exceeding the WHO air quality guideline (WHO AQG) (10 mu g m(-3)), U.S. EPA and Iranian standard levels (12 mu g m(-3)) during entire study period. We estimated that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 contributed to between 24.5% and 36.2% of mortality from cerebrovascular disease (stroke), 19.8% and 24.1% from ischemic heart disease (IHD), 13.6% and 19.2% from lung cancer (LC), 10.7% and 15.3% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 15.0% and 25.2% from acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), and 7.6% and 11.3% from all-cause annual mortality in the time period. We further estimated that deaths from IHD accounted for most of mortality attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5. The years of life lost (YLL) attributable to PM2.5 was estimated to vary from 67,970 to 106,706 during the study period. In addition, long-term exposure to O-3 was estimated to be responsible for 0.9% to 2.3% of mortality from respiratory diseases. Overall, long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and O-3 contributed substantially to mortality in Tehran megacity. Air pollution is a modifiable risk factor. Appropriate sustainable control policies are recommended to protect public health.

AB The psychotherapeutic space is characterised by, inter alia, empathetic participation, that is, sensitivity for the problematic nature of the existence and meaning of everything. The aesthetic disposition is a demand made on the therapist to be receptive to la condition humaine in an existential manner. In this article, I contend that in the face of an unbridled digital culture, the above-mentioned psychotherapeutic quality may be threatened. Furthermore, I scrutinise the nature of this concern in the light of interwoven theoretical and philosophical approaches, and of examples from poetry and literary prose. It is suggested that the training of postgraduate psychology students in general and educational psychology students in particular who have grown up with digital media ought to be reviewed.
   When online digital media become the predominant tool with which meaning is unlocked and interpreted it probably says something about the way people approach their world epistemologically and ontologically. In this regard, the ever-expanding digital consumerism, characterised by utility and immediacy, increasingly serves as hubris through which humanity appears to be doomed to collapse. This collapse would not necessarily mean the disappearance of Homo sapiens, but rather refers to an impoverishment of the function of language and thought in humankind's pursuit of meaning creation.
   Recent research contends that the rapid hybridisation (that is, the fusion of human being and android/machine) to which humankind is exposed occurs at the expense of certain knowledge-gaining and meaning-creating functions. One of these functions is the search for coherence by means of in-depth interpretation frameworks in order to steer away from chaos and fragmentation at the social and personal-psychological levels. Specifically, it concerns the impoverished role of language and thought as vital conditions for the articulation of the fine network of nuances of events and experiences. A predominantly digitalised culture in which the rich register of personal experiences is hardly given a place can lead to the ontology of existence being reduced to filtered, instant experiences and knowledge fragments stripped of their essential nuances.
   Another factor contributing to indifference in the context of the psychotherapist's thinking actions is the inherent fragmentation of the profession of psychology. This often makes it difficult for therapists who pursue the humanistic principles of solicitude and endeavour to fathom the greatest depths of humanity, to position themselves simultaneously within various social systems. Gardner believes "an effective counsellor must radically change his or her perspective on a client throughout the day, viewing the client first through the client's own eyes; then through the eyes of a legal authority or insurance entity; and possibly even through the eyes of a particular agency or school, whose own policies may differ widely from the counsellor, client, or payer" (Gardner 2016:88). According to Gardner, the orientation of metamodernism, characterised by continuous movement and reform, can serve as a conciliatory paradigm to deal with fragmentation and conflicting contexts peculiar to psychotherapeutic practice. She illustrates this fragmentation with reference, in particular, to the one-dimensional reliance on "neo-medical strategies" (Gardner 2016:89), namely rigid treatment plans, diagnostic criteria and DSM1 codes and categories, as opposed to a humanistic approach characterised by human autonomy and integrity. It is suggested that metamodernism as an attitude becomes a way for the educational psychologist of positioning herself in ambivalent environments by means of a to-and-fro movement between conflicting contexts and metaphysical issues related to psychology, such as good/evil, male/female, conscious/unconscious, psychological distress/prosperity, rather than a total rejection of boundaries as in postmodernism.
   In this article, with reference to several theories in philosophy and psychology, analytical literary discussions and recent information science research findings, I endeavour to gain clarity about how the culture of digital media relates to the need for an aesthetic disposition, specifically as a psychotherapeutic quality. In considering this, I explain how art as a direction indicator of the aesthetic disposition can be applied to advance and enrich the thinking of the psychotherapist and educational psychologist.

AB This paper draws on ethnographic, qualitative and survey data with transwomen in Puerto Rico to examine the social and political-economic context of lay injection with hormone and silicone - common practices within this community. We describe specific practices of hormone and silicone injection, the actors that govern them, the market for the sale and distribution of syringes and the networks of lay specialists who provide services to a population that is neglected by and largely excluded from biomedical settings. Our data derive from ethnographic observations, sociodemographic questionnaires, surveys and semi-structured interviews conducted with a diverse group of transwomen in metropolitan San Juan, Puerto Rico. Our analysis focuses on four overlapping social domains or processes that shape the practices of lay silicone and hormone injection among transwomen: (1) the circulation of gender transitioning technologies within local and global markets; (2) the tension between the social exclusion of transwomen and their resilient sub-cultural responses; (3) the cultural meanings that shape transwomen's attitudes about injection; and (4) the perceived consequences of injection. We conclude with a discussion of the kinds of intervention and policy changes that would respond to the factors that most endanger transwomen's health. ResumeCet article utilise des donnees ethnographiques, qualitatives et issues d'une enquete sur des transfemmes a Porto-Rico pour examiner le contexte social et politico-economique des injections d'hormones et de silicone par des personnes profanes - une pratique courante au sein de cette communaute. Nous decrivons des pratiques precises d'injections d'hormones et de silicone, les personnes qui les assurent, le marche sur lequel se vendent et se distribuent les seringues, et les reseaux de specialistes profanes qui offrent leurs services a une population negligee par les environnements biomedicaux et largement exclue de ces environnements. Nos donnees proviennent d'observations ethnographiques, de questionnaires sociodemographiques, d'enquetes et d'entretiens semi-structures avec un groupe divers de transfemmes dans la metropole de San Juan, a Porto-Rico. Notre analyse se concentre sur quatre domaines sociaux ou processus qui, se superposant, determinent la pratique des injections de silicone ou d'hormones par des personnes profanes, dans la communaute des transfemmes : (1) la circulation des technologies relatives au transgenerisme sur les marches locaux et mondiaux ; (2) la tension entre l'exclusion sociale des transfemmes et leurs reponses sous-culturelles resilientes ; (3) les significations culturelles qui determinent les attitudes des transfemmes vis-a-vis des injections ; et (4) les perceptions sur les consequences des injections. En conclusion, nous discutons des types d'interventions et des changements des politiques qui pourraient constituer des reponses appropriees aux facteurs de risque les plus importants pour la sante des transfemmes. ResumenA partir de datos etnograficos, cualitativos y de estudios con mujeres transgenero en Puerto Rico, en este articulo analizamos el contexto social y politico-economico de las practicas habituales en esta comunidad de la administracion de inyecciones de hormonas y silicona por parte de personal no profesional.
   Describimos que practicas especificas se siguen en la administracion de inyecciones de hormonas y silicona, quienes son los participantes que las regulan, cual es el mercado para la venta y distribucion de jeringas, y cuales son las redes de especialistas no profesionales que ofrecen servicios a una poblacion desatendida y excluida en gran medida por entornos biomedicos. Nuestros datos proceden de observaciones etnograficas, cuestionarios sociodemograficos, estudios y entrevistas semiestructuradas llevadas a cabo con un grupo variado de mujeres transgenero en el area metropolitana de San Juan, Puerto Rico. En el analisis prestamos atencion a cuatro dominios o procesos sociales solapados que dan forma a las practicas de administrar inyecciones de silicona y hormonas a mujeres transgenero: (1) la circulacion de tecnologias para la transicion de genero en los mercados locales e internacionales; (2) la tension entre la exclusion social de las mujeres transgenero y sus respuestas subculturales resilientes; (3) los significados culturales que definen las actitudes de las mujeres transgenero sobre las inyecciones; y (4) las consecuencias percibidas de las inyecciones. Concluimos con un debate sobre los tipos de intervenciones y los cambios politicos que responderian a los factores que mas ponen en peligro la salud de las mujeres transgenero.

TI Cosmetic dentistry: A socioethical evaluation
SO BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE cosmetic; dentistry; ethics; professionalism; sociology
ID SURGERY
AB Biomedically, the mouth is often described as a "window on the body"; many systemic health issues may manifest in the oral cavity. The metaphor of a "window" also holds true for the sociological impact of the mouth; judgements and assumptions about social status and affluence may often be made based on dental appearance. The mouth may be used by society to determine the value a person is perceived to place on self-care. Those who are afflicted with dental disease, and therefore have poor dental appearance, are often assumed to be neglectful. Given the importance that is placed upon the appearance of the mouth, it is no surprise that cosmetic dentistry has developed as a service offered by the profession, with novel treatments becoming popular as a way of changing dental appearance. The development of cosmetic medicine has enjoyed wide discussion within the sociological literature. Whilst dentistry has undeniably evolved from medicine, and therefore shares many parallels concerning ethical and social considerations, dentistry differs fundamentally in its organisation, the nature of the conditions most commonly managed and the expectations of patients seeking care. This article investigates the socioethical issues specifically raised by cosmetic dentistry. The dental profession's scope as the protectors and restorers of the oral cavity from the effects of dental disease has now expanded to include the treatment of the flawed smile. Some within the dental profession advocate for commentary on dental appearance to be made to patients as routine practice, accompanied by associated recommendations for possible treatments to rectify perceived deficiencies. The place of cosmetic dentistry as a legitimate professional pursuit has not been explored widely. Comprehensive explorations come from Welie, who analyses both the professional and moral status of cosmetic intervention within the sphere of medicine and dentistry, and from Ozar and Sokol, who consider the place of aesthetic values in relation to other central values in the profession. This article examines closely how cosmetic dentistry is classified and the consequences of this upon the position of cosmetic dentistry as discipline. The inclusion of dentistry in the discussion of the position of cosmetic procedures within medicine is fraught. Whilst the origins of dentistry are from medicine, the nature of dentistry has become somewhat different from its progenitor; the consequences of this in relation to the classification of cosmetic dentistry cannot be overlooked. Within this study of cosmetic dentistry, the reader will note the use of both "patient" and "consumer" as terms to describe those who may seek the services of healthcare professionals. It is noticeable within modern society that many who would have once considered themselves to be patients, now place themselves in the role of consumers, and would describe themselves as such. To place an immediate value upon this as a negative sign of the increased influence of commercial pressures within healthcare would be unreasonable. To be described as a consumer, confers the assumption of a set of rights relating to how one must be treated. Consumers are powerful; emphasis is placed upon their ability to "vote with their feet" and thusly control the quality of service that they receive. Increased choice and freedom to exercise this are also hallmarks of the modern consumer of health services.
   Whilst contemporary discourses upon the role and status of the patient state largely the same, the descriptor would seem only to be held dear to the health professions and those who study them. There is also a potential negative aspect to the introduction of the healthcare consumer; one where the overarching professional duties to do no harm and to engage in the exercise of informed consent seem less important. Here, respecting the ultimate authority of the health consumer to dictate the service that they would like to receive is viewed by many professionals to be equivalent to patient primacy. Where those who seek care are described in this study as being consumers, it is a reference to the status of those seeking treatment as being empowered, and equal to those who provide treatment. It is also an acknowledgement of the rights of care-seekers to be treated as ends in themselves, rather than as means to ends. Where the negative aspects of consumerism in healthcare are encountered, these will be explicitly addressed. This article will have three main areas of discussion. Firstly, the common assertion that cosmetic dentistry is separate from the rest of dentistry, as is often claimed of cosmetic surgery and medicine, will be explored and challenged. In doing this, Foucault's concept of "care of the self" will be used to understand a possible framework where cosmetic dentistry may become a legitimate part of healthcare; the pursuit of self-improvement being an integral aspect of well-being. Secondly, the relationship between cosmetic dentistry and commercialisation of healthcare will be examined. How cosmetic dentistry may be portrayed and "sold" to patients, and the tensions that this may lead to in relation to notions of professionalism. This is an important branch in the narrative surrounding cosmetic dentistry but raises questions that are relevant to professional ethics rather than definitions of cosmetic improvement in the oral cavity. Lastly, another concept described by Foucault will be applied to cosmetic dentistry. The idea of the "dental gaze" suggests that the cosmetic enhancements offered by the dental profession offer a socially mediated control on the concept of the ideal smile. The way that this is often enforced through professional discipline will be explored and critiqued. This study will examine the extent to which criticisms of the professional status of cosmetic dentistry still apply to contempory practice. Foucault outlined his theory of care of the self in the second and third volumes of the History of Sexuality. This idea of ethics examined practices that an individual might engage in, so as to transform their own mode of being. An important aspect of this ethics is the challenge to the established pursuit of the "hermeneutics of the subject," with Foucault placing emphasis upon the care of the self, rather than self-knowledge. Foucault analysed Ancient Greek and Roman texts, developing ideas of how individuals might form themselves as ethical subjects, enabling transformation. The Ancient Greeks took this as how one might live well, whilst under the Romans, this evolved to be concerned with developing the "good-self." He stated the practices facilitating this development to be; "the procedures, which no doubt exist in every civilisation, offered or prescribed to individuals in order to determine their identity, maintain it, transform it in terms of a certain number of ends.
   " Care of the self is characterised by a continual process of self-improvement that may be achieved by many processes, including; self-reflection, self-examination, self-decipherment and self-transformation. Foucault does not pose care of the self to be an obligative duty; it is instead positioned as an ethics that encourages active freedom to engage in processes of cultivation of the self. The concept of care of the self would appear to have implications for cosmetic treatments as acts within the process of self-cultivation. Cosmetic enhancement could be positioned to be an act of self-improvement in line with care of the self; Foucault termed them to be, "technologies of the self." If through introspection, an individual becomes aware of a perceived deficit in their appearance that negatively impacts upon their confidence and self-esteem, having this addressed through cosmetic intervention would be a positive ethical act. Through the ethics of care of the self, we see the normalisation of cosmetic treatment and the removal of the stigma of vanity, and the concept of self-improvement being incorporated within the wider definition of health. Through this, cosmetic intervention may be seen as; "a primary mode for articulating the authentic, healthy and happy self." Cosmetic interventions provided by healthcare practitioners cause definitional difficulty. It is traditionally a point of dispute as to whether cosmetic surgery forms a legitimate aspect of healthcare practice. Proponents of medical professionalism have suggested that the social contract existent between the health professions and society places the purpose of medicine to be the treatment of disease and alleviation of suffering. Cosmetic interventions are specifically excluded from this concept of medical purpose, due to their nature as non-therapeutic procedures within strict definitions of health. Because of this lack of legitimacy in line with the given parameters of medicine, historically, cosmetic surgery has been considered by early physicians; "to be minor, without healing purpose, and relegated to lay-practitioners." Many surgeons would also refuse to perform cosmetic surgery, terming it "beauty surgery." More difficult than addressing whether cosmetic surgery is a legitimate part of medicine, is addressing the question of how cosmetic dentistry integrates with the rest of the pursuits of the dental profession. Oral Health is defined by the WHO to be; "essential to general health and quality of life. It is a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual's capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing." Whilst undoubtedly biomedical in focus, the definition does reference the capacity to smile and the effects of deficiencies in this ability upon psychosocial wellbeing to be firmly part of oral health. Concepts of this strong association between psycho-social and traditional biomedical factors, are made clearer by The World Dental Federation (FDI), who define oral health as; "multi-faceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow and convey a range of emotions through facial expressions with confidence and without pain, discomfort and disease of the craniofacial complex.
   " This definition again references smiling and includes the concept that being able to do so with confidence to be an integral part of oral health. Ozar and Sokol recognise the importance of aesthetic values within dental practice. They acknowledge that dental professionals who paid no attention to aesthetic values would be failing professionally, both from the perspectives of their professional peers, and from the public utilising their services. Because of this, they place aesthetics as a core tenent of the profession's values. Despite this recognition, within their ranking of core values, aesthetics is separated from consideration as part of oral health, which is placed as a higher value than aesthetics. Some have advocated that, as with medicine, a strict demarcation exists in the professional status between dentistry carried out for therapeutic reasons and that which is carried out for cosmetic purposes. Welie states that; "ugliness is not a medical indication; it does not necessitate medical treatment in the same way that a toothache, gingivitis or oral cancer does." He also states that the professional status of dentistry is lost when dentists focus their practices upon the provision of purely aesthetic interventions. The issue of what constitutes a cosmetic or a medical issue is dealt with by Welie by distinguishing between conditions which are healing and those that are enhancing. He uses two examples of similar conditions which both affect dental appearance; firstly, that of cleft-lip and palate, and secondly, the crowding and misalignment of teeth in malocclusion. Welie suggests the term "integrity" as a synonym for health. He questions whether the aesthetic considerations of repairing a cleft-lip and palate is any more medically justified than that orthodontic treatment. He states that integrity is not violated by having an ugly appearance and that whilst aesthetic considerations and side-effects are important; they are not within the realms of medical consideration. Therefore, aside from fixing any functional deformity, both procedures fail to count as being medical procedures if carried out solely on the basis of dental appearance. Welie places culture as the main determination as to why perceived defects in dental appearance are considered to violate integrity; it is social environment that determines attractiveness. He questions whether the improvement of a person's appearance restores integrity, thus making it a bona fide medical intervention, or whether it is an enhancement because ugliness is not a contraindication to integrity. It is of note that Welie does not recognise any differences between the fundamental purposes of medical and dental practice; classing both to have equal foundations within the tradition of treating pathology and pain only. The heavy burden of justification upon cosmetic dentistry is derived from its subjective nature. Orthodontics in not questioned in the same way, despite relying upon the same subjective reasoning for providing treatment. Certainly, by the categorisations of Welie, orthodontics is undoubtedly non-medical in nature, unless aesthetics is not the primary reason for treatment. The intrinsic difference that would seem to exist in other areas of cosmetics and general health is the idea that in cosmetic interventions, the objective is to make the patient more, or better than, well rather than to restore health. Again, in dentistry this point of differentiation struggles to find legitimacy, especially so if the ethics of self-care are considered.
   Rose stated; "The old lines between treatment, correction, and enhancement can no longer be sustained." The apparent lack of distinction between general dentists and "cosmetic dentists" is also testament to the close alignment between cosmetic dentistry and professional activities that treat oral disease. The Health Care Complaints Commission in NSW, Australia stated that; "A central characteristic of cosmetic surgery is that it is initiated by the consumer to improve their appearance and self-esteem." Cosmetic dentistry (and the whole cosmetic discipline) is patient driven, which places cosmetic dentistry in line with ideals of bioethics and consumer culture, where those seeking treatment are empowered. If the traditional purpose of dentistry is expanded to accept the practice of cosmetic dentistry, this new goal of beauty as a good available to consumers, aligns with the reduction of power and authority held by clinicians and with the desire to enhance patient autonomy. Exley suggests that cosmetic dentistry may continue to develop as a normalised aspect of self-care, in the same manner as toothbrushing has become an integral part of most home-healthcare regimes. In this comparison, Exley quotes Davis, who suggests that the rise in the use of toothpastes was, "a social trend greatly aided by the efforts of commercial interests." The social demand to have an aesthetically pleasing smile has also driven the popularity of tooth-brushing. The introduction of active whitening ingredients into many toothpastes, reinforces Exley's comparison and suggests that the social acceptability of dental cosmetic enhancement is likely to sustain its growth in popularity, becoming accepted as part of everyday routine. The triptych of absence that determines the nature of a procedure to be cosmetic is; firstly, the absence of a patient, instead a consumer seeks and initiates treatment; secondly, the absence of pathology and; thirdly, the absence of a therapeutic purpose. Originally, cosmetic surgery was justified through being claimed to act as a psychiatric intervention. As improvements to confidence and self-esteem began to be seen by society as legitimate justifications to cosmetic intervention, much virtue is derived from the desire of the public to seek such treatment. The desire to create improvement of appearance and development of both self-esteem and confidence are ubiquitous within all dental treatments. Given this universality, as well as the empowerment of all patients as health consumers, it is difficult to really distinguish between many cosmetic and traditionally therapeutic treatments in dentistry. Further evidence towards the concept of there being little difference between cosmetic, and the rest of dentistry, is the existence of the idea of aesthetic failure which is a routine consideration in dental practice. Aesthetic failure occurs when a restoration remains structurally and functionally sound but loses its aesthetic properties. This, for many (including those who may think dimly of cosmetic treatments), is justification enough for removal and replacement. Aesthetics is a primary consideration for the majority of dental procedures, often being the only consideration for many patients. This in a stark contrast to medicine, where aesthetics often becomes a secondary consideration; for example, an unsightly scar is perhaps a small price to pay for a successful, life-sustaining surgery.
   References to the mental health of those seeking cosmetic treatments are made by the Medical Board of Australia and General Medical Council (UK) in their regulatory guidance. Medical practitioners providing cosmetic treatments are obliged to consider the need for independent psychological assessment. There is no equivalent guidance from the Dental Board of Australia or the General Dental Council (UK). This absence may indicate a more relaxed attitude within society towards dental enhancement, that to require practitioners to refer when concurrent psychological morbidity presents would be unrealistic and ultimately irrelevant in the majority of cases. However, a more relaxed position does not mean there is any less requirement for awareness of patients seeking cosmetic dentistry who may be suffering with body dysmorphic disorder. Treatment of these individuals with cosmetic dentistry, without addressing any underlying psychological pathology, would not contribute to the increasing of well-being and human flourishing. Therefore, the essential element that the ethics of care of the self would require to qualify an intervention as ethical is missing, rendering the treatment unjustifiable through this theoretical framework. In summary, cosmetic dentistry would seem to be included within the definition of professional dentistry. To exclude it on the belief that improvements in self-esteem and confidence are trivial and non-bona fide justifications deny the widened definition of oral health given by both the WHO and the FDI. It would also serve to excise a large portion of the dental profession, the main role of which is to provide treatments which primarily improve dental appearance. The dental professional goals of yesteryear may have been firmly fixed upon alleviation of suffering. However, in the 21st Century it seems somehow denialist to suggest that the improvement of confidence and self-esteem is not part of the professional purpose of the dental profession. Data pertaining to cosmetic dentistry is scant, the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD) reported that 86% of patients seen by their surveyed members reported that their main reason for seeking cosmetic dental treatment was an improvement in self-esteem. It is of note that the next greatest reason (at 51%) was the correction of previously failed cosmetic treatment. The Academy does not elaborate upon what is defined to be a failure; this could be structural failure or aesthetic failure, where the cosmetic expectations of patients are not met, either immediately or sometime after the procedure. It is difficult to reconcile ideas of cosmetic treatment as an ethical methodology of care of the self, with the image on the front cover of the AACD report. The picture is of a mouth being examined with a common dental mirror. In the mirror, it isn't the patient (or consumer) who is reflected; but the face of George Washington, taken from the US one-dollar bill. It is this overt reference to the financial reward of cosmetic dentistry, that leads to concerns about the relationship between cosmetic dentistry, ethics and professional culture. The semiotics of this image would suggest that it is not the needs of the patient that are reflected in the practice of cosmetic dentistry. Instead, the image suggests it is profit and personal reward that is the driving-force in providing these services. Cosmetic dentistry and surgery is often justified by reference to consumer culture and psychological well-being.
   The narrative of consumer rights and psychological imperatives within cosmetic disciplines is dominant, with procedures being justified purely on the basis that patients have demanded them. Whilst respect for the patient as an autonomous being is the key-stone of any patient-clinician relationship, the idea of the truly equal clinical interaction is a myth. There is commonly a disparity in knowledge between patient and clinician regarding dental treatment. There is a problem with valid consent if it is not used to promote the freedom of a patient through attempts to reduce this informational inequality. For example, we may fully accept a patient's right to seek a cosmetic dental treatment, however, many of these are highly destructive and are likely to carry with them serious repercussions for future oral health and treatment need. For a patient to make a truly free choice, they need to be made aware of this. This is where the "new" paradigm of the patient as a consumer struggles; the professional nature of dentistry requires for the patient to be told of this risk and possible alternatives. The provision of treatment as a commercial good on the presumption that the patient pays their money and takes their choice (or chance), pushes dentistry away from its professional obligation of effacement of self-interest and patient primacy. This tension reveals the issues of viewing cosmetic dentistry to be a consumer-product rather than a bona fide therapeutic intervention, carried out as a full part of the professional purpose. When taken as a consumer product, the emphasis of treatment becomes one of an indulgence; a consumer luxury where the consumer expects their rights of autonomy to be absolute. Here we see the evolution of the dental surgery into the "dental spa," with the world of the beauty industry and clinician colliding. This paradigm leaves little room for the therapeutic alliance; where the skill of the clinician is utilised within a framework of professional (rather than consumer) duty and expectation. The view of the patient as an empowered consumer is to be encouraged, but only in so far as the professional status and associated obligations that accompany this are preserved. The spa-model of dental practice finds procedures to be marketed as "pamper products." Botox, lip-fillers and teeth whitening have seen a surge in popularity within the dental armamentarium. This is despite many regulators of the dental professions worldwide stating almost universally that cosmetic injectables have limited place in the practice of dentistry. The rise in the portrayal of cosmetic dentistry as being a luxurious and pleasurable experience links with the concept that self-improvement through enhancement is fun and exciting. Dental tourism, like its counterpart in the medical industry, is perhaps the ultimate demonstration of this combination between pleasure and cosmetic enhancement. Within medicine, clinicians often argue that "medical spas" are in fact clinics, with preference for the use of medicalised terminology to describe the premises and procedures. This is in contrast to many dental surgeries that focus upon cosmetic treatments in preference to other forms of traditional dentistry, where practitioners seek to distance themselves from the perceived discomfort of conventional dental procedures. The initiation of many treatments within dental practice is patient-driven, but the treatments are not necessarily cosmetic in nature.
   The rise of insurance to cover the costs of oral health needs has contributed to dentistry be more consumer-focused. Patients may attend for a professional clean, with little therapeutic need, in part because they feel it is owed to them for having paid for insurance. This is a phenomenon that has no equivalent in medicine; those with private medical insurance would be unlikely to seek a medical consultation and treatment, simply because they felt that they had paid for it through insurance. The focus upon getting patients into the chair has led to many dentists offering free consultations. Bishop quotes Dr Harlan Pollock, a plastic surgeon, who is critical of such offers, stating; "Free consultations are a gimmick that are used in obtaining patients and they're worth about what they cost horizontal ellipsis They are an opportunity to sell an operation and serve very little purpose." Many cosmetic treatments, such as veneers, teeth whitening and facial injectables, are both the instruments for obtaining a desired effect, and the effect in themselves. The unnatural, bright, white and perfectly aligned smile or swollen and puckered lips are overt status symbols in their own rights and sought after by many for that reason. Franks gives three parameters to consumerism; 1) the pleasure of spending money and conspicuous consumerism; 2) relentlessness and transience, whereby enough is never enough and; 3) the individualisation of the bases and morality of action. In the context of cosmetic dentistry, this may lead to consumers seeking whiter, brighter and more accentuated dental appearances. Leiss articulates this as the practice where; "(T)he needs of self-esteem and self-actualization are expressed and pursued through the purchase of commodities." The push for ever brighter teeth can be seen within the instruments of the dentist. At one time, the "A1" shade was the brightest that was achievable; composite filling materials, porcelain shades and artificial teeth for dentures were made to conform to this scale. This is no longer the case; the popularity of procedures such as tooth whitening have led to the development of brighter shades. Dentists report that for many, the old maximum of A1 has become inadequate. The perceived neo-liberal entitlement to spend resources as an individual deems fit, is an element which society is oriented to defend and preserve. Where cosmetic dentistry is particularly challenging is where patients develop unrealistic expectations, through advertising or direct clinician salesmanship. Where this happens, the development of perceived needs which do not exist, or real needs that are addressed with irrelevant objects, may lead patients to have treatment that is inappropriate. This is where dental practitioners have a need to be robust in the way that they discuss treatments and expectations with patients. Advertising, whilst having the potential to be manipulative, cannot be said to always create false needs. It is easy in this circumstance to use this criticism of consumerism to negate the possibility of cosmetic dentistry being provided justifiably. Leiss states that needs and objects define one another, that ultimately, both real and manipulated needs are underpinned by individual values. The judgement of clinicians, who might feel that the perceived cosmetic defect does not warrant the intervention, asserts one aesthetic ideal over another.
   The act of refusing to provide treatment on this basis, rather than on a basis of judgement on clinical appropriateness, valorises the clinician's view of what is aesthetic. Patients are told that treatment is not possible on the basis that it does not strictly adhere to the normative view of what should be treated. This needs to be accepted as a socially mediated response, that imposes the beliefs of the clinician, onto the patient and judges them based on that schema. Commercialised models of dentistry encourage dental skill to be thought of as a commodity, owned by dental practitioners, available only to those who might be able to pay. As discussed, this contributes to the perception of dentistry to be a luxury good. This applies to all circumstances where dentistry is commodified, not only in consideration of cosmetic practice. In this circumstance, the cost, availability and quality of treatment are determined by open competition between providers, where the self-interest of practice owners and clinicians will bring price and quality into an acceptable balance. In this paradigm, the bioethical principle of justice is replaced by a market-driven model whereby patients may access only that for which they can pay. Welie uses the principle of justice to argue between the separation of medical care and non-medical care. He states that it would be unjust for a society not to offer equal access to dental hygiene, but that it would not be considered unjust for society to have unequal access to an intervention such as laser-eye surgery. This is a valid argument in so far as the wearing of eyeglasses is not a point of stigma within society; considering the popularity of non-prescription eyewear, this is reasonably obvious. However, Welie does not compare like with like. It can be reasonably well established that dental appearance has significant influence over how an individual is perceived in society. Moeller et al. noted a considerably higher public awareness of an association between social deprivation and poor oral health in comparison to other health conditions such as cancer, diabetes and depression. This is believed to lead to greater possibility of association between dental appearance and assumptions being made about socioeconomic status, with the potential for discrimination on this basis. Bedos et al. found that those receiving social assistance, who are disproportionately afflicted with poor oral health and associated poor dental aesthetics, place great value upon the appearance of their teeth. The participants complained about decline in dental appearance and the associated, negative impacts this had upon their self-esteem, social interactions and whether they could secure gainful employment. Reports of hopelessness relating to this situation lead to a preference in extractions and opting for complete dentures. This is supported by Khalid and Quinonez, who state that those without conformity to the expectation of dental appearance celebrated and enjoyed by the social elite, are assigned negative personality and character traits. Whilst Welie might be justified in describing a lack of outrage relating to unequal access to non-medical interventions, the concept of "cosmetic justice" in relation to dentistry holds merit given the huge impacts that effect those who suffer a decline in dental aesthetics.
   Despite this, the NHS in the United Kingdom states that; "NHS dental treatment does not include cosmetic treatments that are not clinically necessary horizontal ellipsis Cosmetic treatments horizontal ellipsis are used to improve the appearance of your teeth and make them look more attractive, and are only available privately." Whilst the boundaries of a public health system need to be realistic, an artificial demarcation between cosmetic and therapeutic treatments assumes that the differentiation between these two categories within dentistry is obvious, if it exists at all. To remain with the example of the NHS, cosmetic operations such as the provision of breast implants have been carried out on the justification of improving mental wellbeing and human flourishing. In would seem incongruous for cosmetic dental treatment to be treated differently. The reality of the situation is that often the demarcation between cosmetic and traditional treatment becomes indistinguishable; providing a patient with a set of dentures to enable them to chew or provision of a crown to aid structural integrity may also have the simultaneous effect of enhancing appearance. One imagines that few dental professionals would argue that the cosmetic improvement was merely a by-product of restoring function. This again shows that the separation of oral health and aesthetics is indeed artificial and that the two concepts are frequently intertwined to the point of being inseparable. In this way, where public dental services are provided, whilst policy directions may state that cosmetic treatment is not available, this is not a position that is practically enforceable; only purely cosmetic procedures are able to be realistically excluded. Whilst cosmetic dentistry is not in itself damaging to professional ethics and professionalism, if undertaken in a manner that is consumer-driven, converted into a commodity, it has the potential, as well as the rest of dentistry and medicine, to radically change the dynamics of the social contract. Commercial strategies such as advertising typically walk a fine line between scaring patients, through directing attention towards possible deficits, and offering pleasure or satisfaction. Advertising has the potential to damage patient autonomy when used in a manner that is manipulative and this practice should be universally regulated and condemned. Dental appearance is a fundamental factor in how individuals are perceived and judged by society. The dismissal of cosmetic dentistry as part of the legitimate practice of dentistry is illogical; the separation should instead be between cosmetic dentistry and commercialism. The tradition of surveillance in dentistry is long established. Nettleton describes the dentist as a "tooth-judge," stating; "The duty of the dentist was not just to invade the mouth but to monitor and regulate and thus to contribute to the policing of bodies." The preventative focus of dentistry is testament to the profession's role in observing and measuring the mouth. Nettleton's description of the dentist-as-judge places the dental professional in a position to exercise disciplinary power. Foucaldian accounts of power allow description of three instruments through which a dental professional may exercise disciplinary power; firstly, through hierarchical observation; secondly by utilising normalising judgement; and thirdly, combining the first two instruments in the process of the clinical examination.
   Through the process of hierarchical observation, subjects are placed into a state of perceived continuous surveillance, regardless of whether this surveillance is continuously in operation. Normalising judgement involves the evaluation and comparison of individual patients to established norms. This allows the dentist to declare patients to be either "normal" or "abnormal" and conformity assured through correction. The examination is the result of the combination of hierarchical observation and normalising judgement. This instrument permits, "the subjection of those who are perceived as objects and the objectification of those who are subjected horizontal ellipsis in this slender technique are to be found a whole domain of knowledge, a whole type of power." Through the dental examination, each mouth could be scrutinised and if deviation from the norm detected, this can be corrected. The power of the dentist has traditionally been used to assert conformity to norms of absence of disease, for example, through the filling of carious teeth, or in the instruction of the proper manner to maintain a plaque free mouth. In the modern era, dentists have expanded their powers of disciplinary observation and the normalising gaze, through social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Advertising pages for dental practices on social media frequently use advertising to remind patients to maintain proper oral hygiene and attend regularly. This also extends to how teeth are depicted, and cosmetic procedures represented. The ideals and beliefs of the dental profession of the ideal mouth may be enforced through the normalising gaze, whereby patients may be subjected to the professionally-held norm of a well-aligned, white smile, in a mouth with lips of ideal proportion. The dental professional does not have to explicitly subject the patient to this norm; the patient is bombarded with messages within the practice environment, through promotional and educational materials. It would be wrong, as Khalid and Quinonez note well, to suggest that the dental profession is solely responsible for the setting of societal norms relating to what constitutes the ideal smile. It would be more appropriate to describe the dental profession as being an enabling factor to society's desire for a mouth that looks a certain way. The profession's disciplinary authority and expertise of what can be achieved, drives the notion of what a disciplined smile may be. It is through schools of professional theory that dentists are trained to exercise their powers of hierarchical observation. The establishment of the dental profession in the early 20th Century led to the legitimisation of the dentist as an authority in enforcing the norms of the ideal smile that are ultimately informed by society. The power of the profession comes from the stigma of poor oral health; "They conform to norms not because they are afraid of the power itself, but because of the possibility of facing penalty, namely, negative stereotyping of individuals with 'bad' teeth." The practices of the dental profession in engaging in exploitative advertising, designed to induce perception of treatment need, and the complicity of professionals in consumption-focused practice (the relentlessness of consumerism) helps to enforced societal norms. Otto illustrates this well in telling the story of Mame Adjei, the winner of Miss Maryland in 2015.
   As part of her competition prize, she is awarded ten thousand dollars towards treatment at one of the award's sponsors; a cosmetic dentist. She tells of how Adjei sits in the dentist's waiting room, bombarded with images of other beauty pageant winners who have received treatment and professional messages such as; "Like they say with the lottery, you gotta be in it to win it. You have to play the game. Life is hard enough and a bright, beautiful smile can help open doors and hearts." Following her consultation, Adjei reports feeling more aware and critical of her teeth and decides to embark upon the treatment recommended to her. After this, Otto describes a person in conflict; Adjei has had the treatment she perceived she needed to progress in the pageant world but is also disturbed by the process; "I'm like an art project horizontal ellipsis I don't think I needed it horizontal ellipsis I don't mind my little special things about me. Now my teeth look like everyone else's." This is a stark example of the "gaze" being applied to ideal norms of aesthetic beauty. The "gaze" of the cosmetic dentist becomes manifest in the use of computerised or conventional technologies that show patients the predicted outcome of treatment. Programmes may alter patient's smiles digitally or through the "diagnostic" wax-model of teeth produced by the dentist to show what might be realised through cosmetic intervention. Here the dentist specifies the parameters of how they will transform the smile. These processes can be likened to the whorls and lines of the cosmetic marker pen in surgical consultations. The specialised training and professional status of dentists, places them in a position of authority. This authority, combined with the culturally derived notions of ideal dental aesthetics, makes it difficult for dental professionals to be neutral participants in changing the appearance of the mouth. The dental profession could be seen to have a vested interest in not challenging prevailing social norms; after all, cosmetic dentistry will always offer dentists an alternative stream of income regardless of any decreasing prevalence of dental disease. It could be argued that the dental profession has a duty to contribute to the destigmatisation of alternative appearances, addressing the paradigm where individuals with facial and other deformity are disabled by the culture around them rather than any physical or functional impairment. Twine notes that there is a tendency to scoff at how foolish society was in the days of yesteryear to place any weight upon the pseudo-science of physiognomy, and yet how prevalent these ideas within society still remain. Through a collective addressing of this issue in dentistry, the profession may have the potential to alter prevailing cultural attitudes towards the ideal dental appearance, especially as teeth are an essential part of the physiognomic assessment that is often made of an individual's character and morality. Comment should be made on the fluidity of cultural preferences in dental appearance. Blackened teeth, that elicit stigma and assumptions of low socio-economic status and self-neglect in Western culture today, would have led to opposite conclusions of affluence in the 16th and 17th centuries. The cost of sugar in these periods meant that tooth decay was an affliction of the rich.
   Likewise, tooth blackening (as opposed to teeth whitening) was once considered to be an enhancement of beauty, partly favoured as it disguised the sharpness of canines which were associated with animalistic or evil tendencies. Within Japanese culture, there is a preference, in some, for "yaeba"; a characteristic appearance where the canine teeth are prominent. It is believed that this prominence suggests a youthfulness and is considered to be attractive by many. Whilst many have their teeth aligned to conform to the Western preference of straight teeth, having orthodontics to pronounce canines is still relatively common. Across cultures, preferences in tooth appearance may contrast and the current preference for uniformity in alignment and enhanced brightness in Western culture may change in the future. In this discourse examining cosmetic dentistry, the problems of attempting to separate the practice of dental cosmetics, and treatments that may be categorised as treating dental disease and suffering, become evident. The insistence that cosmetic dentistry somehow sits outside of the professional purview of dentistry is untenable based upon both how oral health is defined, and the great value that society places on dental appearance. Instead, the distinction must be made between cosmetic dentistry and commercially-focused dentistry, where the practice and role of the dental professional changes to being one more similar to a facilitator of consumerist culture. Often, this is where tensions between cosmetic dentistry and notions of professionalism have arisen, the established and commonly-held belief being that commercialism and that aspect of dentistry are inextricably linked. Cosmetic dentistry has no moral value attached to it that makes it immediately objectionable to professional purpose. Where this becomes compromised is through the introduction of action of behalf of the profession that conflict with the effacement of self-interest, such as exploitative advertising, overtreatment or defacement of the dentist-patient relationship into one of commercial exchange. It can be concluded that cosmetic dentistry can deliver benefits to oral health and join the pantheon of professional dentistry, but only when the requirements of informed consent that preserve patient autonomy and resistance to commercial factors are observed. The ethics of care of the self and the concept of the dental gaze may be thought to be opposites of the same coin; patients should have the freedom to consume cosmetic dentistry in a manner which will develop personal growth and self-improvement. To refuse cosmetic dentistry as an ethical tool for this purpose would be to deny a bona fide instrument of self-cultivation. The converse in this relationship is the dominance and authority of the dental profession, with the dentist placed as the arbiter of the norms of dental appearance. Professional judgement is then developed into a sales-pitch to sell this normalised view of what dental appearance should be. In this, the dentist acts to validate and impose the socially determined parameters of what might be considered an ideal dental appearance. The findings of this study into the nature of cosmetic dentistry have implications for how treatment that is primarily aesthetic in nature may be judged by the profession, and by those that fund public dental services.
   The widening of the definition of dentistry to include cosmetic treatments may have unwelcome implications for the funding of dental treatments, but the consequences of poor dental appearance upon social status, employability and relationships cannot be forgotten.

Introduction Definitions and Legitimacy: Self-Care Ethics and Concepts of Cosmesis in Dentistry Cosmetic Dentistry and Consumerism The Dental Gaze and Cosmetic Dentistry Conclusion Footnotes Cosmetic dentistry is a divisive discipline. Within discourses that raise questions of the purpose of the dental profession, cosmetic dentistry is frequently criticised on the basis of it being classified as a non-therapeutic intervention. This article re-evaluates this assertion through examination of ethics of care of the self, healthcare definitions and the social purpose of dentistry, finding the traditional position to be wanting in its conclusions. The slide of dentistry from a healthcare vocation towards being a predominantly business-focused interaction between clinician and consumer conflicts with traditional notions of dentistry as a profession. Whilst it is undeniable that cosmetic dental treatment particularly lends itself to the commercial paradigm, this is not exclusive to this area of professional practice. The cultural basis of dental appearance and the potential of the dental profession to exert coercive pressure upon the public to undergo treatment that is based upon social norms is discussed.
   This essay concludes that cosmetic dentistry is undeniably part of the professional purpose of 21st Century dentistry. However, the caveat that may be placed upon this, is that this status is conditional upon the professional conduct of dental practitioners remaining resilient to commercial practices not compatible with professional obligations.
