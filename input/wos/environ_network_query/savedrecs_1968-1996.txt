AB This commentary explores the relationship between the principles and goals emerging at the international level and those being employed by nations in their domestic ocean governance schemes. While the U.S. was a leader in pioneering new aspects of environmental policy in the early stages of the environmental movement (late 1960s to late 1970s), recent advances such as the mandated use of an ecosystem approach now are occurring more often at the international level. It is suggested that environmentally oriented NGOs play an increasing significant role in the diffusion of new principles and norms, both between various types of international regimes and between the international and national levels. In this connection, large, well-supported global conferences like the 1992 Earth Summit (UNCED) have served to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of global networks of environmentally-oriented NGOs.

TI Control of community information: An analysis of roles
SO LIBRARY QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Many formal and informal sources within a community disseminate community information. People seek information from their peer-kin network, directly from service providers, and from intermediaries, such as libraries and information and referral (I&R) agencies. I&R agencies specialize in community information by maintaining an inventory of the area's human services and disseminating that information to the public. Another recently developed vehicle for this information is the online community network, an electronic environment where service providers can post information about their services and members of the public can then access that information using a computer and modem. But the respective roles of I&R agencies and community networks are unclear: are they, in part or in whole, providing the same service or product? What are the implications for funding and data collection if they are? If not, what relationship, if any, should they have with each other? This study explores the differences between I&R agencies and community networks from an information policy perspective and uses a framework proposed by Wilkinson (1992) to analyze the positioning of control within the two intermediaries under six facets: agency ownership and governance, funding, information flow, access, information ownership, and quality control. Existing community networks and I&R agencies are used as examples to illustrate the arguments.

TI SINGLE ISSUE LOCAL-AUTHORITY ASSOCIATIONS - A NEW SPECIES FOR A CHANGING
   ENVIRONMENT
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this article is to explore the emergence of single issue local authority associations as a response to the changing nature of the central-local government policy community in the past decade.  The main theme of the article is that a gap has been created by the restructuring of local governance that neither individual local authorities nor the broad local authority associations are equipped to fill.  Hence, new single issue local authority associations such as the Coalfield Communities Campaign, have been formed.  They are necessitated by the unwillingness of broad local authority associations to preoccupy themselves with sectional and possibly divisive single issues and the inability of individual local authorities to command sufficient power within the policy community.  As such they may well represent a fundamental change in the policy network, though it remains to be seen whether or not they will have a long-term role.

TI ENERGY RECYCLING SYSTEM FOR URBAN WASTE HEAT
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONF ON URBAN CLIMATE, PLANNING AND BUILDING
CY NOV 06-11, 1989
CL KYOTO, JAPAN
AB Today, energy is indispensable to daily life all over the globe.  Nevertheless, it is clear that energy cannot be consumed without limit given the finite nature of resources and environments.
   The consumption of abundant amounts of energy today unavoidably releases huge amounts of waste energy to the surrounding environment from houses, offices, shops, factories, subways and other facilities.
   Heat pumps can raise the temperature of waste heat to a usable temperature range with the use of a small quantity of driving energy.  In this way heat pumps act like water pumps, which can lift river water to a higher elevation by using a small amount of driving energy.
   Thus if a piping network for gathering and transporting waste heat is available, heat pumps can efficiently supply useful heat to customers by recovering energy from waste heat.
   If the waste heat of cities can be recovered, a kind of energy recycling system can be constructed using heat pump technology.  This will result in the efficient use of energy and the conservation of our precious natural environment.
   For individual use, a heat source network might be too expensive.  But waterworks and sewer systems in cities can be used for this purpose with slight modifications.  In many cities, maintaining a sufficient water supply is becoming a real problem, leading to the promotion of water recycling and separate networks for the provision of drinking and non-drinking water.  Sewers are one of the main repositories of waste heat, and sometimes waste heat is then diffused to rivers and lakes which are water supply sources.  A heat source network would distribute waste heat and protect the environment at the same time.
   A heat distribution network using heat pumps also has advantages over conventional district heating systems:  little heat loss, economical district piping, easy expandibility, and the ability to make use of a variety of waste heat sources.  Such a system can efficiently meet the complex needs of modern cities where heating and cooling demands coexist in a variety of areas.  A heat pump can heat and cool both simultaneously and alternatively, and works best in balancing heating and cooling demands.
   In this way energy recycling systems using heat pumps can play an important role in daily life through energy and environmental conservation.  Consequently, energy recycling systems should be introduced as part of our social system from the viewpoint of urban planning, energy policy and environmental protection.
   A model project will be introduced with actual operational experiences.

AB The network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Spain began to take shape at the beginning of the current decade. Although MPAs are limited both in number and in area, they do however operate within a legal framework which enables the protection of natural space to be extended to the maritime environment. Given the state's political-territorial organization, protection initiatives come from both the central government and the autonomous regions. This means that a greater degree of coordination is necessary between the 10 riparian autonomous regions and the national administration.

ID WATER DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; METHODOLOGY; COSTS
AB A nonlinear heuristic is developed for use in obtaining least-cost pump-operation policies for multisource, multitank water-distribution systems. The proposed algorithm links a minimum-cost-constraint identification methodology with a network-simulation model in order to provide the resulting policy. The algorithm has the advantage of being computationally efficient while incorporating the nonlinear characteristics of the water-distribution network. In addition, the algorithm has the added advantage of providing several feasible solutions to the control problem, which then provides the system operator with increased flexibility in selecting a particular policy.

DE PROCESS CONTROL; NEURAL NETWORK; SELF-TUNING; GLOBAL POLICY LEARNING;
   LOCAL EXPERIENCE LEARNING
AB The characteristics of the PENN (Policy- and Experience-driven Neural Network) controller were examined by applying it to water-level control. This controller is driven by two learning mechanisms: (1) global learning based on control policy and (2) local learning based on previous experience. The applicability of the PENN controller was tested by simulating water level control of a conical vessel. The neural network used in this study is composed of only four units-three for the input layer and one for the output layer.
   The effect of continuation of learning, the capability to follow the change of system characteristics, the effect of noise or misjudgment of time lag are discussed.
   The results found and the fact that this controller has no specific parameters to be tuned in advance showed that it is very adaptive and sufficiently strong against noise.

AB A method was developed to capture the results of a computationally intensive irrigation optimization routine through the use of neural networks. The PNUTGRO peanut crop growth simulation model was modified and incorporated into a routine to search for optimal irrigation decisions using the Sequential Control Search approach. The daily environmental conditions and crop state variables associated with these optimal irrigation sequences were used to train cc irrigation scheduling policy. The simulated net returns above irrigation costs using the neural network irrigation control policy were only $4/ha less than the average for the same seasons using the Sequential Control Search optimization.

AB An educational game for water quality management is developed to assist a novice engineer or student to learn the compromises among three major objectives to manage water quality: cost, water quality, and equity. A window-based interface is developed on a microcomputer. A hypothetical example with four dischargers is used in the program, and the initial scenario is based on a uniform treatment scheme. The player acts as the manager of a water quality authority to design the best compromise policy. The friendly interfaces allows one to exercise judgment in selecting and in modifying discharge permit programs. The design and development of the game and related computer program are described. Network accessibility has provided a novel environment for remote education. A prototypical multimedia network interface is provided for local or foreign remote access to the game.

AB When independent administrative domains (ADs) interconnect their networks, usage control mechanisms are needed to preserve the autonomy of each AD. Neither traditional network access control methods nor current internetwork routing protocols are well-suited to the enforcement of network usage policies. Consequently, new policy sensitive inter-domain routing protocols are under development. While these protocols are designed to enforce network policies, they raise new security-related concerns.
   This paper explores the design of transit control mechanisms for sensitive environments and investigates the performance overhead of the proposed mechanisms. After evaluating the application of stub-network access control and policy routing techniques, we describe and evaluate a secure policy routing protocol for transit ADs.

These routing policies are obtained by generalizing similar schemes used in circuit-switched networks. Fixed-point performance evaluation algorithms are developed and numerical studies are performed to compare the routing policies in networks of different size and traffic conditions. The routing policies are further extended to the multipoint environment, wherein relative performance and the issues relating to implementation are discussed.

AB In the wake of increased environmental and sustainability concerns associated with agricultural development, developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choice between the short-run technological gains and the long-run environmental conservation. A dynamic investment decision model is developed to optimize the use of scarce public investment funds in the management of irrigation water supply, depth to water table and soil salinity. Four major classes of investments with different impacts on the hydrological balance within the Indus basin are considered: (a) expansion of the surface irrigation network, (b) public drainage projects, (c) tax and subsidy policies designed to influence the rate of private groundwater exploitation and (d) investment in improving the efficiency of the existing canal system by reducing conveyance losses. The crop area lost due to water logging and salt accumulation is treated as a damage cost of increasing the application of surface irrigation water. The resulting optimality conditions from the model are used to assess the development and operation of public drainage projects. The model results are compared for areas underlain by fresh and saline groundwater. The model is also used to analyze recent policy debate which has focused on the use of incentives such as subsidized credit, energy subsidies, and electrical grid expansion to accomplish the transfer of tubewell operation from the public to the private sector. Optimal switching conditions for such transfers are derived. The results show that a private farmer's optimal decision will diverge more from the societal optimal decision as more externalities from surface irrigation are accounted for.

AB We consider the problem of optimally scheduling a processor executing a multilayer protocol in an intelligent Network Interface Controller (NIC). In particular, we assume a typical LAN environment with class 4 transport service, a connectionless network service, and a class 1 link level protocol. We develop a queuing model for the problem. In the most general case this becomes a cyclic queuing network in which some queues have dedicated servers, and the others have a common schedulable server. We use sample path arguments and Markov decision theory to determine optimal service schedules. The optimal throughputs are compared with those obtained with simple policies. The optimal policy yields upto 25% improvement in some cases. In some other cases, the optimal policy does only slightly better than much simpler policies.

ID MODEL
AB Models that assume optimizing consumers and rational firms fail to account for market resistance to cost-effective energy-efficiency improvements.  This paper looks for clues in social science research on organizations and technology change.  An alternative model derived from those literatures is proposed which focuses on the role of organizational networks in shaping and constraining innovation.  This perspective is applied to data from a study of residential cooling, in which we find that producer networks routinely limit technology transfer in a variety of ways.  Some of the influences of market factors, industry structure, technical knowledge and ancillary network actors (eg architects, appraisers, realtors, lenders, utility managers and code officials) are explored.  Non-energy developments that are likely to influence future energy-efficiency choices in these systems are also considered, and research and policy recommendations are offered.

TI POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR DATA-NETWORKS
SO COMPUTING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB For the purposes of the present discussion, a network is the telecommunications arrangement for transporting digital traffic from place to place, and the boundary is considered to be at the interface between it and subscriber systems. Both homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks are described and discussed in detail, and security concerns and threats are presented. The focus of concern is the heterogeneous network (e.g., the Internet); which provides data communication services to all interested and qualifying parties. Such a network behaves in the spirit of a common carrier but is not today legally characterized as such.
   Security of a network is an essential topic not only in behalf of safe, reliable, and proper functioning of the ensemble, but also because lack of it can lead to circumstances in which subscriber disappointment and rejection will threaten the goals and hopes for network acceptance and success. A review of the development of computer security and network security as national policy and standards issues is presented.
   With regard to security-related policy that the network authority may wish (or may be obligated) to adopt, there are several categories of interest. Among them are the following:
   Policy to protect the network against specified threats and to ensure its safe, reliable, and proper functioning.
   Policy to control the nature, details, and conditions under which pro bono or for-fee service offerings to the network at large can be provided, or may be required to provide as a condition of being allowed to connect (e.g., electronic mail).
   Policy to protect subscriber traffic while it is in the custody of the network in which it is stored or while in transit through it.
   Policy to govern subscriber behavior in regard to its interaction with the network, including usage.
   Policy to protect each subscriber against improper or malicious behavior by one or more other subscribers.
   With regard to networks that are funded by or related to federal interests, any or all of these may become binding through law or regulation. Other federal policies, such as limitations on the use or export of cryptography, can intrude on freedom of choice for network policy and operators.

This program, called Whales '93, is one component within a series of multidisciplinary IUSS dual use initiatives that have an impact on the ocean's environment and on national policy. These other programs include acoustic thermometry of ocean climate, acoustic telemetry of time-critical ocean data, fisheries enforcement, and nuclear explosion detection and discrimination. The signatures of the low-frequency vocalizations from four mysticetes (baleen whales) are presented to illustrate their unique characteristics.

AB Recently, hub-and-spoke networks employing central hub facilities to channel flows between interacting nodes have become popular with successful applications in ground and air transportation. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the design of this type of distribution. network with networking policies and models together with exact and heuristic solution procedures. We consider two networking policies: (i) Nonstrict hubbing, in which channeling flows through hubs is not required but chosen if found cost efficient and (ii) strict and restrictive hubbing, in which all flows to/from a node are channeled through the same hub. Variations of these policies are discussed together with various aspects of air passenger and cargo transportation, effects of network organization on demand and network design. under continuous economies of scale. The performances of the proposed algorithms and the effects of the networking policy implemented on the hub locations and the route structure are studied using data on air passenger flows between the top forty U.S. cities in 1989.

AB A network flow programming-based model, KCOM, was developed to simulate water allocation and distribution in the surface water system of Kern County, California.  The model will help the California Department of Water Resources plan the proposed Kern Water Bank conjunctive-use project.  KCOM incorporates recharge and pumping features to allow simulation of both surface and subsurface water distribution.  Network flow programming-based simulation was chosen for KCOM because of its generality, flexibility, speed, and superior ability to reflect complex water allocation policies.  The water allocation capabilities of network flow programming-based simulation were enhanced in KCOM by the development of a sequential flow allocation technique, in which sources are allocated in different layers to meet only demands with authorized access to those sources.  A validation simulation demonstrates the model's capabilities, and sensitivity analysis underscores the need for improvement of the data used to describe the system.  Recommendations are made for the improvement of KCOM.

AB Reservoir operating policies are derived to improve the operation and efficient management of available water for the Aliyar Dam in Tamil Nadu, India, using a dynamic programming (DP) model, a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model, and a standard operating policy (SOP). The objective function for this case study is to minimize the squared deficit of the release from the irrigation demand. From the DP algorithm, general operating policies are derived using a neural network procedure (DPN model), and using a multiple linear regression procedure (DPR model). The DP functional equation is solved for 20 years of fortnightly historic data. The field irrigation demand is computed for this study by the modified Penman method with daily meteorological data. The performance of the DPR, DPN, SDP, and SOP models are compared for three years of historic data, using the proposed objective function. The neural network. procedure based on the dynamic programming algorithm provided better performance than the other models.

AB The article presents a new thermodynamic model of continuous-time neural networks.  The model is based on the thermodynamic fluctuations theory.  The differential equations describing the behavior of the network in time are derived and analyzed.  The analysis shows that the dynamics of the network is characterized by the time behavior of the Helmholtz free energy of the system.  The possibility to control this behavior by the time-dependent temperature schedule is also discussed.  The emphasis of the article is on the local energy minima escape in optimization problems.  Two simulations of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) have been used to demonstrate the discussed approach.

AB Comprehending external environments is an increasingly important facet of the work of senior public servants. The purpose of this paper is to introduce concepts that will help practitioners and academic observers to describe and analyse the structure and dynamics of policy communities. The paper first draws from the political science literature to identify different networks in policy communities, considering how the role of public managers changes from network to network, and then models policy communities as ''learning'' entities consisting of advocacy coalitions responding to policy challenges in competitive and cooperative interactions. The paper concludes that public managers have a special stewardship function in facilitating more productive learning within policy communities.

AB This paper investigates the effect of reservoir operation on downstream water quality. This is accomplished by the following procedures. An automated channel network extracting system, C-NES, is used to extract channel network from Digital Elevation Model and a distributed rainfall-runoff model is adopted to estimate the streamflows. The relationship between water quality and streamflows is established Subsequently, a reservoir water quality model, WASP, is employed to predict water quality under several sedimentation conditions and operation policies. Different reservoir operation rules are simulated to address the possibility of maintaining water quality through proper operation. The watershed of Ta-Chi Reservoir in Taiwan is chosen as a case study. The simulation results show that an appropriate operation rule can improve outlet water quality by releasing water from a certain depth outlet in the reservoir. This is because the flow field that influences the bio-chemical reactions is altered. It is suggested that careful consideration of the outlet positions should be included in the future design and operation of a reservoir. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This work examines policies based on multicasting for load sharing in a local area network environment. In these policies, lightly-loaded nodes join multicast groups to indicate their ability to accept additional work, and heavily-loaded nodes send multicast messages to locate these lightly-loaded nodes. Simulation is used to study the performance of these load sharing policies and compare them with previously proposed load sharing policies. The results show that multicasting is an efficient method for locating lightly-loaded nodes, yielding better response time compared to previous policies. In addition, the results show that multicast-based policies can be used to lessen network traffic to busy nodes and nodes on remote LANs, while scaling to large numbers of machines.

AB Probabilistic forecasts, probabilistic models, and contingent policy recommendations are inextricably intertwined.  This article describes a case study in the use of inherently probabilistic belief network models to produce probabilistic forecasts of average annual oil prices.  Belief networks are flexible enough to capture both standard, data-driven economic variables, and quantified expert judgements about the politics of the oil market (particularly the production and capacity policies of key OPEC members).  These variables are interrelated by a combination of algebraic formulas, conditional probabilities, and econometric relations.  The resultant network is used to test the impact of a variety of different scenarios.  The probabilistic forecasts generated by running Monte Carlo analyses on these scenario networks provide corporate decision-makers with useful insights and recommendations.

TI BRINGING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO RURAL AMERICA - THE COST OF TECHNOLOGY
   ADOPTION
SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examines the factors that are working for and against the development of an advanced telecommunications infrastructure to serve rural areas of the USA. There is a notable difference between the costs of local network upgrades for existing rural telephone subscribers and of bringing service to new and physically remote subscribers. The latter group should be treated separately for policy purposes. The infrastructure serving the existing subscriber base could be upgraded to a digital network without necessitating large rate increases, provided there is sharing of network facilities between the energy, transportation and telecommunication sectors. The preferred medium is likely to be digital fibre.

AB This paper describes a package developed at the National Technical University of Athens which determines the optimal expansion policy over a period of N years for a limited size generation system consisting of wind generators (WECs) and photovoltaic (PV) panels operating in parallel with a large scale network. The produced energy from the wind generators and the photovoltaic panels is directly injected to the local grid or transmitted to the interconnected system. Given the meteorological data of the installation area, historical load data, the characteristics of the proposed additions (WECs and PV panels), the cost of the energy and the associated escalation rate, the package finds the optimal expansion policy for the period of next N years, utilizing a dynamic programming algorithm.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF MISSING TRANSPORT NETWORKS IN EUROPE
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB In view of increasing spatial interaction in Europe, missing transport networks represent a serious problem. In this paper, strategies of coping with the problem of missing networks are discussed from an economic policy perspective. It is argued that instead of the traditional approach of investments in transport infrastructure, software-oriented strategies and organizational measures should be envisaged to increase the performance of the transport networks. The implications of such measures for transport and the environment are discussed in the context of welfare economics. It is concluded that introducing useful policy strategies will have to overcome the resistance of the actual winners of national regulations.

DT Article
ID EQUILIBRIUM METHODS
AB In this paper we develop a transportation network policy model that determines the equilibrium flow pattern and the transportation link tolls or taxes/subsidies in the presence of imposed transportation goals on the links of the network. The penalties (and subsidies) are functions of the deviations from the targets. The governing equilibrium conditions are shown to satisfy a variational inequality problem and existence and uniqueness results are presented using this methodology. A decomposition algorithm is proposed that resolves the problem into series of traffic network equilibrium problems and true simpler subproblems. Convergence results are also given. Finally, the algorithm is applied to numerical examples that illustrate how the model can be utilized for transportation pricing policy, as well as the numerical performance of the algorithm. This work extends recent research in spatial market policy modeling with goal targets on bipartite networks and with fixed penalties.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB This paper describes a neural network based modeling scheme of parameter function modeling that captures the inherently nonlinear dynamics of fed-batch bioreactor systems. A neural network model in conjunction with basic material and energy balances provides a better representation of the system dynamics than a purely empirical model. The combined balance relation and neural network parameter function model can be used with dynamic programming optimization to generate optimal operational policies. The results of applying this method to two fed-batch bioreactor systems are presented and shown to agree well with exact optimal strategies.

TI FROM AN IRON TRIANGLE TO AN IRON DUET - HEALTH-POLICY MAKING IN ISRAEL
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICINE
AB The paper addresses five constructs of policy making:  policy curtain, iron triangle, issue network, policy community and an iron duet.  The five constructs are distinguished on the basis of two variables:  exclusion, denoting the degree of openness to new participants, and interdependence, pertaining to relationship between participants.  A policy curtain prevails in the pre-agenda stage denoting both exclusion and lack of dependence.  Iron triangle is characterized by exclusion and interdependence; issue network portrays inclusion and lack of interdependence; a policy community features inclusion and interdependence.  A fifth construct - an iron duet combines characteristics of an iron triangle, an issue network and a policy community.  The paper suggests that the five constructs of policy making are not only products of political environment but are affected by distribution of resources and primacy of values within a specific issue-area.  It further argues that a sequential development may take place following alterations in the division of power between state agencies and organized groups.  The involvement of powerful groups of professionals in a policy community, produced by mutual dependence of state and association, may lead to formation of a policy (iron) duet.  The historical evolution of specialization entitlement in Israeli health policy serves as a case study to illustrate the major arguments of the paper.

AB The merging of telephone and computer networks is introducing multiple resources into networks, and information is becoming increasingly distributed across the network. Related services are being integrated onto a single network rather than being offered on separate uncoordinated networks. In this paper, we focus upon communication networks that integrate multiple services using multiple resources.
   In particular, we look at the decision of whether to accept or deny service requests in such a system. We prove a conjecture for the optimal policy for a related system introduced in [7] and characterize the optimal coordinate convex policy for our multiple service, multiple resource system.

TI NATURE CONSERVATION PLANNING IN EUROPE - DEVELOPING ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS

LA English
DT Article
DE NATURE CONSERVATION; NATURE CONSERVATION PLANNING; PHYSICAL PLANNING;
   ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS
AB Ecological networks are becoming an important issue in nature conservation policy in Europe. Nature conservation in Europe developed from site protection in its early phase into planning systems for nature conservation in the present time. Ecological networks are based on landscape ecological principles and consist of core areas, corridor zones, buffer zones and, if needed, nature rehabilitation areas for the re-establishment of nature. The content of the networks is a reflection of their objective, the phase of nature conservation and the planning system of a region or country. In this review a distinction has been made between (1) pioneer networks, (2) networks as the basis of a nature policy plan and (3) networks as part of an integrated national or regional plan. Ecological networks are developed at several geographical and administrative levels and these levels should be integrated. The present time period is considered to be crucial for the development of nature conservation policy because of the many changes that are now taking place in Europe.

TI POLICY COMMUNITIES, ISSUE NETWORKS AND THE FORMULATION OF AUSTRALIAN
   HIGHER-EDUCATION POLICY
SO HIGHER EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TERTIARY EDUCATION
AB Governments in most western countries consult extensively with clientele groups in the process of formulating higher education policy. The nature of these consultative mechanisms, in turn, influences the manner in which decisions are made, and the substance of policy outcomes. This article explores the changing style of government-interest group interaction in Australia over the decade 1985-94 and how these changes have effected the way policy is determined. It is argued that Australia has gone through three phases over that time. Until 1987 policy was formulated by a stable 'policy community'. From 1988-90, when a number of major reforms were introduced, this framework was replaced by a brief period of 'state direction'. During the early 1990s a new environment characterised by unstable 'issue networks' emerged.

AB Transnational networks of nongovernmental organisations have won important policy changes at the World Bank. Three networks, on environment, poverty and structural adjustment, have diverse approaches to expanding participation, with varied implications for relations among the World Bank, states and societies. While campaigning to expand the participation and influence of poor communities, they also have strengthened and broadened the World Bank's influence in borrowing countries.

   area networks
AB In this paper, we present a predictive congestion control policy for transporting data traffic in a high-speed wide-area network, in the presence of real-time traffic, such as voice and video traffic. The policy is based on information exchange between adjacent nodes of the network. The evolution of the buffer content at a node is determined by the real-time traffic arrival process, the data traffic from upstream nodes, and the ability of the downstream nodes to absorb the data traffic. The predictive policy attempts to predict the buffer content of a node one round trip delay into the future. Based on this prediction, in each time period, a node informs its immediate upstream neighbors, of the maximum rate at which they can transmit data traffic. This rate must be low enough to keep losses low and high enough to keep the throughput high. We characterize the real-time traffic by its mean rate, its variance and the correlation. We study the performance of our scheme over a wide range of real-time traffic parameter values. We investigate the effect of higher link speeds, and larger propagation delays on the performance of the network. We study the unfairness that results when sources are at different distances from a common access node, and propose a solution to overcome the bias towards the near source. We also compare the predictive policy to other end-to-end control policies. Our investigation shows that the predictive control policy performs significantly better than the static or adaptive end-to-end rate control policies.

TI Fair-efficient call admission control policies for broadband networks -
   A game theoretic framework
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENT
AB A fundamental problem in connection oriented multiservice networks (ATM and STM) is finding the optimal policy for call acceptance. One seeks an admission control policy that efficiently utilizes network resources while at the same time being fair to the various call classes being supported. The theory of cooperative games provides a natural and precise framework for formulating such multicriterion problems as well as solution concepts. In this paper we describe how this framework can be used for analysis and synthesis of call admission strategies in broadband networks. In particular, we investigate the Nash, Raiffa-Kalai-Smorodinsky, and modified Thomson arbitration solutions from game theory. The performance of all solutions is evaluated by applying the value iteration algorithm from Markov decision theory. The approach is illustrated on a one-link network example for which the exact solutions can be achieved. The results indicate that the arbitration schemes from game theory provide some attractive features especially when compared to traditional control objectives: blocking equalization and traffic maximization. We also compare the optimal solutions with some simplified policies belonging to four different classes: complete sharing, coordinate convex, trunk reservation, and dynamic trunk reservation. The comparison indicates that in many cases, the trunk reservation and dynamic trunk reservation policies can provide fair, efficient solutions, close to the optimal ones.

AB Funding support, and the realization by fishery managers that social science research has much to offer in the management process, have combined to create a framework for important research activity in recent years. This paper describes three projects of varying breadth, depth, and scope in which social scientific scholarship has both theoretical and applied value. The first project was a research effort in which funding first allowed for the construction of an appropriate theoretical model and hypotheses, and then supported the research, application, and evaluation. The second project illustrates how available theory and methods can be adapted to the solution of a basic problem in fisheries management, namely how to involve those who are affected by policies and regulations in the formation of those policies and regulations. The third project addresses the issue of conflict of fisheries management and locates marine resource conflicts within a larger conceptual context. This is also an area in which there has been a reluctance to face squarely the research needed to provide for more effective management.

TI GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN JAPAN - THE CASE
   OF MARINE ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTATION
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Two general factors (minimal basic research and closed domestic markets) are thought to favor the relative competitive position of Japanese firms with respect to the firms of other countries. However, it is likely that the scope and degree of these effects depend upon the specific characteristics of individual markets. Thus a close examination of the structure of individual markets and the behavior of films and government agencies in those markets is needed. in this article, we examine the industrial organization of markets for marine electronic instrumentation (MEI) in Japan and the scope of government policies in support of the development of these advanced marine technologies. We estimate the total value of Japanese MEI production (total export and domestic sales) at between U.S.$992 million and U.S.$1.04 billion. Of this, only 16-18 percent is sold directly to export markets, particularly to U.S. and European civilian end-users. The absence of foreign competitors in the Japanese domestic market is more a function of the size and scope of the market than of specific government policies to restrict the entry of foreign firms. Government research and entry opment programs do not appear to give preference to the products of Japanese firms except on a cost basis. Government financial support for ''headline'' technologies (e.g., deep diving submersibles and remotely operated vehicles) has not contributed to a competitive advantage for Japanese firms. More important to the success of a few Japanese MEI firms in, international markets have been (1) the establishment of strategic alliances with U.S. firms in the 1960s and 1970s involving technology transfer in combination with the use of existing distribution networks and (2) marketing strategies that have focused on after-the-sale servicing and repair

TI AGRICULTURE, ENVIRONMENT AND THE STATE - THE DEVELOPMENT OF
   AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY-MAKING IN THE NETHERLANDS
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Agro-environmental policy formation is described as an interaction between the agricultural policy community and the environmental policy network. The agricultural policy community is defending its monopoly in the agricultural sector and its corporatist structure. The environmental policy network develops strategies to gain more influence in this semi-closed domain of agriculture. Agro-environmental policy formation can be seen as a subtle interweaving of environmental and agricultural biases. On the basis of a case study of the 'region-oriented approach' in a Dutch region, an illustration is provided of agro-environmental policy formation in practice. This study shows that the insulated and integrated character of the agricultural policy community is disappearing, in favour of processes of self-regulation at the regional level. Secondly the Ministries of the Environment and Agriculture are developing a common frame of reference. One of the results of this process is alienation from and conflicts with their respective constituencies.

AB The supplier of wood fuels has a large number of interrelated activities to coordinate on the way from raw material source to consumer. Transports, storing and intermediate processing should be decided on for a number of assortments. Storing is a prominent feature of this network flow problem since consumer demand is high when small amounts of raw material become available and vice versa. Storing may, however, change the energy content of the material. This paper presents the effects of these changes on operational planning, procurement and storing policies for a wood fuel supplier. Under the assumptions of the application, it is shown that if these changes are taken fully into account, the efficiency of fuel production can be increased by about seven percent.

   COMMUNICATION
AB ''Demand side management (DSM) is the deliberate influence of customer appliance selection and energy use patterns to achieve a desired impact or load shape consistent with company goals'' (EPRI). Demand side management has two aspects: develop efficient utilization for electricity, (less electricity for each utilization), and take measures to encourage the customer to help flattening the load curve. The tariff policy conducted by the EDF towards the large customers connected to the high voltage and to the medium voltage networks is already very efficienty in flattening the load curve. This paper stresses a particular aspect of DSM: in the actions taken to extend this DSM policy to domestic customers, the same approach based on tariff incentives will be used. In the near future the domestic customer will have the possibility of choosing tarrifs which reflect the variations of the cost of electricity through the day and through the year. To be efficient this policy must rely on the development of products, which make energy management a very easy job for the customer. This is the reason why EDF is involved in the development of home automation technology. This technology will allow low cost communication between the customer meter and different systems in the home (like heating, lighting, domestic appliances). It will also allow the development of services concerning, for instance, security (burglary, fire, water leakages etc.). One of the highest priorities is put on efficient carrier current transmission. It is a backbone of EDF's policy in this matter: it allows transmission of ''real time'' tariff information from the utility to the customer's meter. It is then one of the media for transmission of information from the meter to all the equipment in the home (with the advantage of requiring no installation). Besides these technical developments, experiments are done to test the acceptance of customers of these new tariffs and services. This DSM policy, based on new technology, and on early testing of services with customers, will allow further improvement in the load curve, to the benefit of the customer and of the utility.

AB Future multimedia environments are expected to be distributed and heterogeneous. In such environments, media sites ranging from sophisticated workstations to simple media capture and display subsystems such as ISDN videophones and audiophones (together referred to as Mediaphones) that lack the capability to run clock synchronization algorithms will be connected directly to the network. Towards such environments, we develop mechanisms and protocols for synchronous access to multimedia services over integrated networks. In the inter-media synchronization technique we present, for facilitating synchronous retrieval, a multimedia server computes at the time of recording of a multimedia object a range of relative temporal positions or stamps (called an RTS interval) for each media unit that it receives from mediaphones. During playback, the multimedia server detects RTS mismatches between media with the help of feedback messages transmitted back by the mediaphones, and steers the mediaphones back to synchrony. We propose predictive policies for resynchronization and compare their performance for video/audio playback with other resynchronization policies, such as conservative, aggressive, and probabilistic. These performance studies reveal that predictive policies perform uniformly well at all levels of asynchrony, unlike their conservative and aggressive counterparts. Moreover, in most cases, predictive policies match probabilistic policies in effectiveness, without imposing the same computational demands as the probabilistic policies.

TI Dynamic mobile user location update for wireless PCS networks
SO WIRELESS NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB The basic architecture of a personal communication network consists of a wireline network and mobile terminals. Each mobile terminal communicates with the wireline network through a nearby base station. In order to route incoming calls to a destination mobile terminal, the network must keep track of the location of each mobile terminal from time to time. This is achieved by location update such that each mobile terminal reports its current location to the network at specific time points. When an incoming call arrives, the network will page the mobile terminal starting from the last updated location. A trade-off, therefore, exists between the frequency of location update and the number of locations paged in order to track down the mobile terminal. This paper introduces a location update policy which minimizes the cost of mobile terminal location tracking. A mobile terminal dynamically determines when to update after moving to a new cell based on its mobility pattern and the incoming call arrival probability. The performance of this scheme is close to that of the optimal policy reported earlier. However, the processing time requirement of this scheme is very low. The minimal computation required by this scheme enables its usage in mobile terminals which has limited energy supply and computational power.

   THE EDGE OF CHAOS; COMMUNICATION
AB In integrated water management, the issues are often complex by nature, they are capable of subjective interpretation, are difficult to express in standards and exhibit many uncertainties.
   For such issues, an equilibrium approach is not appropriate. A non-equilibrium approach has to be applied. This implies that the processes to which the integrated issue pertains, are regarded as ''alive'''. Instead of applying a control system as the model for tackling the issue, a network is used as the model. In this network, several ''agents''' are involved in the modification, revision and rearrangement of structures. It is therefore an on-going renewal process (perpetual novelty).
   In the planning process for the development of a groundwater policy for the municipality of Amsterdam, a non-equilibrium approach was adopted. In order to do justice to the integrated character of groundwater management, an approach was taken, containing the following features: (1) working from global to detailed, (2) taking account of the history of the system, (3) giving attention to communication, (4) building flexibility into the establishing of standards, and (5) combining reason and emotions.
   A middle course was sought, between static, rigid but reliable on the one hand; dynamic, flexible but vague on the other hand.

TI OPTIMAL POSITIONING OF SAFETY STOCKS IN MRP
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The positioning of safety stock in multi-echelon production networks operating in an MRP environment is considered. Our aim is to maximize the service level achieved for a given total amount of safety stock. Most previous research considering MRP environments has been empirical or heuristic, but the approach we take is analytic and concentrates on two network types: serial and divergent networks. Using previous results on the MRP ordering logic, we show that in serial networks the optimal policy positions all safety stock at the end stock-point. This result is independent of the stochastic nature of the demand, the type of uncertainty and the measure of service used. The analysis of divergent networks is more complicated because of the need for material rationing. We show that the optimal policy may depend on the total amount of safety stock available, the variability of the demand, the structure of the lead times, the choice of the rationing policy and the measure of service used.

DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; LESSONS
AB Policy implementation brings together multiple agencies and groups to work in concert to achieve a set of objectives. Making these joint arrangements function effectively depends upon multiactor linkages and coordination. Drawing upon the interorganizational and policy network literature, this article discusses these issues and applies them to National Environmental Action Plans (NEAPs). The article looks specifically at Madagascar, examining the implementation structure of the NEAP and how coordination problems are manifested. The essay concludes with some recommendations directed toward improving the effectiveness of Madagascar's NEAP, but which have wider applicability to managing coordination among policy implementation actors in general.

AB Cost-based admission and routing have been widely discussed and used in telephone switching networks, but their application in a multirate high-speed network is severely hindered by the enormous number of states of the Markov model describing the network. In this paper we show how to apply the concept of quantization to reduce the states of the model. Once the state space is reduced, conventional techniques can then be used to compute the cost function for a cost-based admission and routing scheme. The proposed method is policy-independent, meaning that it can be applied to different call admission policies.

TI DYNAMIC-NODE-NUMBERING CONCEPT IN CHANNEL NETWORK MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Al-Hassa Irrigation and Drainage Authority in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia covers approximately 8,000 ha of cultivable land. To project, a precast concrete open-channel system has been in operation since 1971. This open-channel network, which consists of 19 mains, 178 submains, and 1,641 laterals, has more than 1,800 valves and vertical gates to divert water in different reaches of the system. The water is distributed according to a predefined irrigation schedule. In order to decide gate operating policies, a computer package known as channel network model has been developed to simulate depth and discharge variation with time under unsteady-state condition. This paper introduces dynamicnode-numbering concept in channel network model by which the control devices can be completely closed and the original schematic diagram, node numbering, and corresponding data for the modified system are internally updated without altering the original data files. This paper also addresses other features of the model such as gate operation under low differential head, interactive capabilities of the model, and simulation of large-scale irrigation network

AB In accordance with the reform policy of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, open access to natural gas pipeline networks should allow large customers an opportunity to compete for cost-effective natural gas supplies. The competitive criterion is that all potential customers have equivalent access at the market clearing price to any building blocks in natural gas transportation service. Access to firm transportation capacity rights, defined as reliability priority blocks at critical bottlenecks, is a workable mechanism for planning and managing capacity allocations on the pipeline network. A concurrent auction optimization model provides an allocation of and prices for capacity rights for a given period, with allocations reflecting the willingness to pay.

AB The distinctive feature of industrial policy towards the motor industry in the 1980s was the transformation in government policy from one of subsidizing BL to active encouragement of Japanese inward investment. This article focuses on the key events of the BL privatization and illustrates how the changing nature of the government's relationship with BL and the motor industry was a fundamental influence on policy change. It also examines the utility of policy network models in accounting for policy outcomes in a highly politicized policy environment.

DT Article
ID WASTE MANAGEMENT SITES; ENGINEERING DESIGN; REGULATORY POLICY; NETWORK
   DESIGN; CONTAMINATION
AB A network design approach developed in this paper identifies monitoring sites in multilayered, regional ground water flow systems at risk of contamination from waste storage facilities. Candidate locations are assigned weights that quantify monitoring value in terms of the prospect of plume detection and exposure hazard criteria. Detection criteria are based on the location of a site with respect to the source of contamination and potential contaminant plumes. Exposure criteria are based on the size of the population that consumes water from a supply well and the distances between the supply well and probable zones of contamination. The weights are used in a binary integer mathematical programming problem which selects the monitoring locations. On a 100-point rating scale developed to quantify composite plume detection and characterization efficiency, the network design model scored 87, compared with a score of 76 for a pre-existing monitoring network. (The model and pre-existing schemes involve the same number of wells.) The model selects well sites that are close together near the source of contamination, facilitating early detection of a contaminant release, and further apart downgradient, resulting in areal coverage for plume characterization.

AB Parallel independent replicated simulation (PIRS) is an effective approach to speed up the simulation processes.  In a PIRS, amultiple simulation runs are executed independently computers in parallel.  The statistical properties for a PIRS may be affected by the scheduling policies.  For an unbiased PIRS scheduling policy, a reliable distributed computing environment is required.  We consider an unbiased PIRs scheduling policy on a distributed platform such as a network of workstations.  We observe that including more computing resources may degrade the performance of PIRS.  Simple rules are proposed to select processors for PIRS.

DE environmental policy; pulp and paper; life cycle; optimization;

AB Will paper recycling reduce the environmental impact of the European pulp and paper sector? If so, is maximal paper recycling the best policy to optimize the life cycle of the pulp and paper sector? We explore these questions using an approach that combines materials accounting methods and optimization techniques. Environmental impact data are inputs for a Linear programming network how model to find optimal configurations for the sector. These configurations consist of a mix of different pulping technologies, a geographical distribution of pulp and paper production, and a level of recycling consistent with the lowest environmental impacts. We use the model to analyse scenarios with different recycling strategies. Recycling offers a reduction in environmental impact in regions with a high population and a large production of paper and board products. Regions with a large production of graphic products should focus on cleaner virgin pulp production with energy recovery. We conclude that relocation of paper production also offers a reduction in environmental impact. However, the severe effects on the economy make this policy less attractive than a combination of recycling, cleaner pulp production and energy recovery. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In a dynamic manufacturing environment, an operational policy prescribes when and how tasks are assigned to resources.  Recent research has investigated the behavior of operational policies that can be tailored to specific manufacturing situations through the selection and evaluation of pertinent manufacturing decision making (MADEMA) criteria.  Often, however, the relationship between the relative importance of these criteria and the overall performance of the manufacturing system is impossible to analytically establish.  This paper explores the use of neural networks for identifying the relative importance of these criteria for given performance goals of the manufacturing system.

AB The effects of changing system parameters on job scheduling policies are studied for load balancing of multiclass jobs in a distributed computer system that consists of heterogeneous host computers connected by a single-channel communications network.  A job scheduling policy decides which host should process the arriving jobs.  We consider two job scheduling policies.  The one is the overall optimal policy whereby jobs are scheduled so as to minimize the overall mean job response time.  Tantawi and Towsley obtained the algorithm that gives the solution of the policy in the single class job environment and Kim and Kameda extended it to the multiple job class environment.  The other is the individually optimal policy whereby jobs are scheduled so that every job may feel that its own expected response time is minimized.  We can consider three important system parameters in a distributed computer system:  the communication time of the network, the processing capacity of each node, and the job arrival rate of each node.  We examine the effects of these three parameters on the two load balancing policies by numerical experiment.

TI FUEL EFFICIENCIES, ALLOCATION OF FUELS AND FUEL COSTS FOR POWER AND

SO DESALINATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The top management or the owners of a company are mainly interested in the overall economics and productivity of their industrial plants, and are always on the lookout for analyses which should be able to guide them in their decision and policy making processes.
   They usually like the overall outputs to be compared to total inputs in terms of quantities and costs, are generally not bothered about the intricacies of individual plant/unit efficiencies and the technicalities, and therefore they are always looking towards simple and easier ways to assess their operations, plant effectiveness and economics.
   For the owners of a cogeneration power plant producing power and water, it is just another industrial plant which should produce two saleable products, from burning the fuel and processing the sea water. Cost-wise this should be economical and balanced.
   The Water and Electricity Department (WED), Abu Dhabi, has been using various types of hydrocarbon fuels as the main source of energy inputs for its power and desalination plants. The experience in fuel control has resulted in development of a proposed novel methodology for the analysis of combined power and desalination plants as a single unit, as far as fuel efficiency, the allocation of fuels to power and desalination and the relevant specific fuel costs for power generation and water production are concerned.
   The paper presents the idea of using a heat value for potable water produced from desalination of sea water. It discusses the use of overall fuel efficiency of the system for fuel allocation to power and desalination, and balancing the energy input against the output of power and desalination plants in the WED network, based on its own data.

TI A small-scale spatial analysis system for maritime Australia
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Within the field of resource and environmental management, the paramount value of a spatial analysis system is as a fool for regionalising a case-area in diverse directed ways, each being useful for (i) increasing scientific understanding of that area (intellectualisation) or (ii) for allocating operational categories (for example, funding categories, regulatory categories) differentially between parts of the case-area (called operations support or policy support). Success in serving these scientific and administrative values depends in turn upon two primary attributes of the spatial analysis system and a larger number of secondary attributes. These primary attributes are (i) the range and quality of geocoded data sets held in store or able to be accessed and (ii) the range of spatial analysis techniques which can be called upon for operating on stored data sets. Secondary attributes influencing a spatial analysis system's value include its accessibility to potential users, its ease of use, the judgement and experience of its users and the quality of its cartographic and other outputs. The present paper is a status report on the Australian Coastal And Marine Resources Information System, CAMRIS, a spatial analysis system developed as a demonstration for Australia. CAMRIS contains or can access raw and value-added data sets which comprehensively cover both terrestrial and marine components of the Australian maritime estate. Onshore, for the immediate coastal strip, data held or accessible include geocoded data on vegetation, geology, landform, wetland and coastline type, land use, climate and population. For coastal drainage basins, data sets include river networks, river flows, wetland attributes, soils, geology, elevation, vegetation, mineral deposits, beach attributes, population,and bird distributions. Nearshore data include geocoded data on estuary attributes, island attributes, seagrass beds and marine protected areas. Offshore (oceanic) geocoded data held or accessible include bathymetry, sea surface temperature and salinity/dissolved oxygen profiles, together with a variety of geophysical records including gravity, magnetics, seismic track lines, substrates, waves, winds, storms, tides and cyclones. While raw data are stored as such whenever available, many of these data sets are in value-added form, held perhaps as a surface or choropleth or as a function of primary data items. A range of spatial analysis techniques is routinely available for application to CAMRIS data sets including those within the SPANS, Are Info, and Idrisi geographic information systems, the S Plus exploratory data analysis package, and specialist in-house packages such as PATN for multivariate positive classification and LUPIS for resource allocation and normative classification. CAMRIS demonstration studies in various stages of completion address: (1) selection of coastal and marine protected areas; (2) identification of priority areas for the management of land-based marine pollution; (3) planning for coastal population growth; and (4) synoptic impacts of climatic change in the coastal zone. Further candidate studies being considered include mariculture prospects and proactive management of oil spills and leaks. An important indicator of success for the CAMRIS project would be for it to be seen as a prototype for a properly-funded multi-agency national maritime (coastal and marine) spatial analysis system
   Australia, with one of the worlds largest and most diverse maritime estates and with a small population imposing increasing pressures on that estate, needs powerful policy and operations support tools.

AB The problem of determining the optimal operating policy for a system of reservoirs equipped with hydroelectric power plants is a nonlinear programming problem. In general, practitioners have found it hard to solve even a problem for a system with a small number of planning periods and hydroelectric plants using current nonlinear programming techniques. This is due, in large measure, to complex nonlinearities of the power generating functions and a large number of linear equality constraints involved in the model. Furthermore, most reservoirs systems in arid regions have periods of low water level which often results in an empty feasible region adding considerable difficulties to the operational feasibilities of the solutions. In this paper, we provide a general formulation of the water resource allocation problem with explicit engineering details generally omitted or oversimplified in the published literature, and investigate several solution procedures for their applicabilities, and we develop an efficient algorithmic framework exploiting the general water resource system special network structure to solve the linear equality constraints. Practical feasibility of this approach is demonstrated in several applications with a real water resource system.

AB Two rival products are supplied under perfect competition. Their negative network externalities are not allocated socially optimal under individual technology adoption. One product is adopted too often in relative terms, both in absolute terms. So there is a potential to raise efficiency of product choice by measures of public policy.
   Under dynamic network externalities congestion is impossible. But a product can be individually choosen even if another user could later derive greater utility from its adoption. Identification of potential welfare gains as well as derivation of appropriate policy instruments is complex while intuitive in some simple implementations.

AB What size sample is sufficient far spatially sampling ambient groundwater quality? Water quality data are only as spatially accurate as the geographic sampling strategies used to collect them. This research used sequential sampling and regression analysis to evaluate groundwater quality spatial sampling policy changes proposed by California's Department of Water Resources. Iterative or sequential sampling of a hypothetical groundwater basin's water quality produced data sets from sample sizes ranging from 2.8% to 95% coverage of available point sample sites. Contour maps based on these sample data sets were compared to an original (control), mapped hypothetical data set, to determine at which point map information content and pattern portrayal are not improved by increasing sample sizes. Comparing series of contour maps df ground water quality concentration is a common means of evaluating the geographic extent of groundwater quality change. Comparisons included visual inspection of contour maps and statistical tests on digital versions of these map files, including correlation and regression products. This research demonstrated that, down to about 15% sample site coverage, there is no difference between contour maps produced from the different sampling strategies and the contour map of the original data set.

AB During recent decades, rented housing estates all over Europe have become the object of a flood of programmes aimed at physical and social renewal and regeneration. Drawing upon network theory, in this paper a conceptual framework is presented and tentatively applied in a comparative study of rented housing regeneration and area improvement in England and Sweden. Although the contours of broadly similar policy communities in the two countries could be found, there were also striking differences in network formation. Thus, in England the Department of the Environment seems to play a more prominent role in policy-making and implementation than its Swedish counterpart, while in Sweden the municipal housing companies, the local authorities and the tenants' organisations take part more actively in the policy process than is the case in England. Closely related to these findings it is argued that there are also some lessons for practical use that could be learnt from the analysis, although one then has to be careful not to overlook the context-bound specificities, at the national as well as the local level.

TI SWISS TRANSPORT POLICY FOR EUROPE - FEDERALISM AND THE DOMINANCE OF
   LOCAL-ISSUES
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues that as a function of the federalist structure of Switzerland, policy projects are treated as if they were local public goods.  In case of transport policy proposals with important spatial externalities, this may prove to be fatal for the integration of Swiss transport infrastructure into the European transport networks.  Empirical evidence for the relevance of local issues is given in this paper for five votes on road-transport issues with a European impact in Switzerland in 1984 and 1990.  It is concluded that European transport infrastructure networks risk to be incomplete if federalist elements in national decision-making lead to a dominance of local issues.

DT Article
ID OPTIMAL OPERATION; OPTIMIZATION; METHODOLOGY; COSTS
AB The requirements and basic components of a typical optimal control environment for water-supply pumping systems are presented and discussed. Examined model components include hydraulic network models, demand forecast models, and optimal control models. A review of existing optimal control methodologies for water-supply pumping systems is also provided. Examined methodologies are classified on the basis of the type of system to which the methodology can be applied (single source-single tank or multiple source-multiple tank), the type of hydraulic model used (mass balance, regression, or hydraulic simulation), the type of demand model used (distributed or proportional), the type of optimization method used (linear programming, dynamic programming, or nonlinear programming), and the nature of the resulting control policy (implicit or explicit). Advantages and disadvantages of each approach are presented, along with recommendations for future work. The applicability of current technology to an existing water-supply pumping system is examined in light of existing technical limitations and operator acceptance issues.

TI DEREGULATING THE EUROPEAN RAILWAY INDUSTRY - THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND
   PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB It is well known that a pure privatization policy for the railway sector, as it has been implemented in the US, can solve financial problems, but the price which society has to pay for this policy is that the railway companies have to give up considerable parts of the transport market.  As this contradicts the objectives of European transport policy, other ways must be found to increase the market efficiency of the railways without losing the benefits for the environment which stem from substituting car/air travel and road haulage by rail transport.  One of these ways is to subdivide the railway system into (at least) two distinct organizations:  a network company which is publically owned, controls the investments, and sells network capacity units at prices compatible with public goals, and a set of operation companies which operate on private accounts and maximize profits.  The relationships between the government, the network, and the operation divisions may be formulated as principle agents problems.  In the paper the decision levels of the publically controlled network cooperation, the operation companies, and the users are defined.  The decision problems on each level are described in formal terms and the interfaces between these three levels are pointed out.  Finally, some approaches to reorganize the railway system in Europe are described and lessons for the German case, where a new structure for the organization is crucially needed because of the new political situation after the German unification are derived.

AB In this paper we consider whether consensual approaches to environmental policy making-that is, policies that seek to foster cooperation and the search for consensus among industry, environmental groups, and regulatory authorities-are likely to succeed when pursued by states and local areas. Recent work in industrial and urban ecology suggests considerable benefits derive from a regulatory approach centered around cooperation, trust, and the search for consensus among interested parties. The conditions under which such consensual approaches to policy making are likely to succeed, however, are not well established. Drawing upon an emerging literature on trust and cooperation in advanced industrial economies, we examine whether local levels in the state are well positioned to pursue a consensual approach to environmental policy making. The research design involves case-study analysis of two environmental initiatives in Massachusetts-namely, the Toxics Use Reduction Act (1989) and revisions to state hazardous-site clean-up laws. The research clarifies the significance of overlapping material interests and of the process of consensus building in achieving successful environmental policy reform.

AB Managed Objects (MOs), contributing to management by performing management tasks, are regarded as critical components of distributed management systems. This paper proposes a model for enriching MOs with components supporting management policy and describes a prototype implementation of the model. The main use of the idea is to add management functionality dynamically to MOs as required by management policy. It could also be used to create that part of MOs that interact with real resources. The prototype implementation was done in Smalltalk-80 and was used to test the ideas discussed.
   The paper stresses the roles of management domains and management relationships. The model uses these concepts to create components representing management functionality.
   Although the model is described for a Network Management (NM) environment the same concepts apply to the general area of Distributed Systems.

More than 75 of these chains provided perennial water following the breakup of the ancient city of Sijilmassa. Khettara continued to function for much of the northern oasis until the early 1970s, when new technologies and government policies forced changes. Data on origins, maintenance, and current use were collected from archival sources, aerial photographs, Landsat imagery, and from interviews. Insufficient water resources and unsustainable practices have dramatically lowered the watertable, drying up khettara. This has resulted in a loss of local control over water resources, abandonment of a sustainable irrigation system, and progressive desiccation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI OPTIMAL CHANNEL ALLOCATION POLICIES FOR ACCESS-CONTROL OF

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOCKING PROBABILITIES; NETWORKS; STRATEGIES; SERVICE
AB The problem of adaptively managing the transmission bandwidth of an integrated network by implementing optimal partitioning policies for the access control of circuit-switched traffic is studied. Precise formulations within an optimization framework of access control problems, both at an isolated multiplexer level (access port problem) and at the overall network level (network access problem), are developed. These formulations are based on the policy of partitioning the bandwidth of each multiplexer among the competing traffic streams, which is motivated by the simple implementation it renders for the adaptive updating of bandwidth allocations to track dynamical load variations. For the simple case of a single multiplexer supporting traffic with identical bandwidth requirements, an elegant iterative scheme with guaranteed fast convergence is presented for the determination of optimal channel allocations. For the more general scenario of a multiplexer supporting traffic with nonidentical bandwidth requirements, a methodology is developed to handle the access control problem by a mixed-integer programming formulation. This methodology is further extended to the network-wide access control scenario, and some implementational issues are discussed. A detailed quantitative evaluation of the proposed algorithms is conducted under different loading conditions, and the corresponding performance and efficiency are compared with those of other known procedures.

TI Innovative land use and public transport policy - The case of Curitiba,
   Brazil
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the land use policies implemented in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, from 1965 to the present, Curitiba used land use planning, the hierarchy of the road network, an economic development policy and public transport to coordinate the parameters for the location and density of homes, work, recreation, services and commerce. The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working, Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management. The paper describes the integration of land use/transportation policies and the instruments that contributed to its enforcement and attempts to draw selected lessons from the experience.

AB Teacher networks are a recent innovation in professional development that are being used in California and Vermont to support state policy initiatives. Our analysis relies on interviews, observations, and document analysis to identify how teachers' program experiences are affected by the fit between their backgrounds and program goals and methods. Drawing on insights from symbolic interactionist and social movements theory, we treat the teacher networks in these states as professional-area movement organizations sharing the common goal of changing instruction in a constructivist direction. First, we describe the common goals of the programs in both states. Then we describe key features of the network programs and their different policy environments. finally, we identify how teachers' beliefs, background experiences, social influences, and contextual circumstances can color their program experiences and willingness to make changes in classroom instruction.

AB Recent developments of high-speed networking technologies and transmission media make it feasible to have diverse multimedia applications over integrated service networks. In order to guarantee Quality Of Presentation (QOP) to users, it is necessary to negotiate QOP parameters at the networking connection setup time, and it is also necessary to maintain service qualities during the time of presenting multimedia information. In this paper, we propose using a multimedia synchronization method for supporting smooth presentation of live multimedia information in ATM-based networking environments. The mathematic relationships among the buffer size, the maximum jitter, the presentation and transmission rates, the maximum intra- and inter-media asynchrony anomalies, etc., are presented in detail. We perform a bounded buffer allocation scheme, and forward synchronization policies for synchronizing live video and live audio streams. Since the transmission rate of live media cannot be adjusted, we perform the forward synchronization policies to overcome the asynchrony anomalies. The presentation processes at the receiver site monitor the presentation asynchrony anomalies. Once the anomalies of presentation are detected, the forward re-synchronization policy is triggered to eliminate the asynchrony anomalies. Neither a global clock nor a feedback mechanism is needed using our method.

AB This study set out to improve the capacity of Finnish policy makers to design and implement long-term waste management policies. Since policy makers must frequently act on incomplete information and process the information they receive through mental models that can lead to inefficient or myopic choices, the methodological approach was to analyze the structure, substance, and institutional context of the mental models with which key policy makers in Finnish waste management rationalize their long-term decisions. Individual scenarios were analyzed for inconsistencies that indicate how institutions constrain policy decisions and what institutional changes might enable policy makers to better prepare for the long-term future. To map the cognitive models that underlie waste management policies, interviews were conducted in 1992 with 24 decision makers and experts on Finnish waste management. The main finding is that the exclusion of long-term ecological sustenance is a systemic, built-in characteristic of Finnish corporatism. Corporatist institutions nurture environmental policy makers' short-sighted mental models, which in turn are the rationale for the short-sighted corporatist institutions. The principle unifying the recommendations is the administrative and procedural separation of conflicting environmental policy interests, and the simultaneous empowering of sustainable goals with appropriate institutions.

Network-oriented research approaches indicate a broader set of organizational and environmental variables. The issue of trust in network relations implicates contextual aspects such as the socio-cultural foundation of people's interaction. The striving toward more complex, multi-level models of strategy is seen to put a heavy burden on the development of adequate strategy research methods. The paper reports and interprets experience from a case study of inter-organizational exchange governance in small firms. The discussion suggests a need for more in-depth knowledge of cultural contexts, and of socioeconomic relations of actors within strategic networks. The paper recommends a search for new methodological inputs from other academic disciplines more experienced with human interaction research. In particular, methodological tools found within the field of social anthropology are recommended.

DT Article
AB This article investigates the relation between economic development and the infrastructure in the Randstad. The findings on the impact of infrastructure on urban economic development are rather indecisive. The Randstad economy depends heavily on its position as a node in international transport networks. This position is threatened by increasing traffic performances on the existing infrastructure and new policy issues such as environmental pollution. National and international infrastructure policies are examined for their impact on the international competitiveness of the Randstad.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Networks are expected to support applications with diverse traffic characteristics and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, such as voice, data, video and multi-media. In this environment it is important to determine whether a given QoS vector is achievable (for call admission control), and if it is, design efficient resource allocation policies that deliver it.
   In this paper a system of T resources (wireless channels) shared by a number of un-buffered applications is considered. Packets which are not allocated a channel within the current assignment cycle are dropped. The QoS vector is equivalently described in terms of (diverse) packet dropping probabilities (p(i)), or (diverse) packet dropping rates (d(i)). The region of achievable QoS vectors is precisely determined and easy to implement scheduling policies that deliver the achievable QoS vectors are derived. Some applications to call admission control and resource management are presented along with some numerical examples.

AB The ecological framework for the study of child abuse is briefly described and the present study-of two adjoining economically depressed localities with contrasting rates of child abuse-is theoretically located within the framework. The study focuses on the neighbourhood as a potential source of support for families, the study design emphasizing the character of the neighbourhoods as social entities. The social character and reported child abuse histories of the two study neighbourhoods in Western Sydney, Australia, are presented, and the research instruments and procedures used in a household survey, are described. Demographic data, parents'/carers' ratings of (i) the social environment, (ii) the locality as a place to raise children, (iii) transport and communication patterns, together with membership of nine sub-networks of each carer's support network, are analysed. The one outstanding difference between the two localities was found to be the structure of the networks of the two samples of residents. In the area with a higher rate of abuse there was a relative lack of connection between more immediate (familial) and more distant parts of the social networks, a finding which parallels the results of several earlier studies of clinical and non-clinical populations.

AB Success Of many projects depends on inclusion of socio-cultural viewpoints (paradigms) at the policy formulation and project planning stages. Semantic networks may be used to represent relationships among individuals and groups to evaluate hypotheses about paradigm change in the social systems within which policies are enacted. Expert systems may then be used to determine parameter values in socioecological models formulated to evaluate the economic con sequences of policies reflecting environmental management paradigms.

TI GIS AND NETWORK MODELS - ISSUES FOR 3 POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Geographic Information Systems (GISs) are now being developed for urban transportation planning and modeling. Supporting other recent work, this paper demonstrates the combination of GIS and network-based, urban transportation planning (UTP) modeling software to create powerful tools for the analysis of policies and plans. Following a literature review and informal survey identifying GIS and UTP modeling software in use at transportation agencies, three applications of GIS for network modeling and relevant issues are discussed: 1) developing or modifying UTP models, 2) incorporating network data into a GIS framework, and 3) creating and using a high-speed interactive system suitable for providing near real-time alternatives and policy analysis. Some specific suggestions are made related to the use of two software products, and extensions to other platforms are noted. Conclusions allude to the potential of such systems while realistically pointing to the present difficulties and magnitude of effort that will be required.

TI FUTURE OF AIRLINE HUBBED NETWORKS - SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB By hubbing at a few airports, airlines can maintain high levels of aircraft utilization and take advantage of the economies of aircraft size. Passengers also benefit in the form of increased frequency of service. However, increased aircraft operations at major hubs imply certain diseconomies that include congestion delay, increased workload on air-traffic controllers, noise, and pollution. Using a network equilibrium model, this study attempts to project the future structure of domestic networks and to discuss some policy implications. The results suggest that network hubbing will continue to persist as an important feature of air transportation, but in a multihub system. Unless expanded substantially, major hubs will suffer from escalated levels of delays and will become mostly traffic-generator airports instead of connecting and transfer points. Some implications to the concept of wayports, hub pricing, and the role of aircraft technology in relieving delays at major hubs are also discussed.

SO COMPARATIVE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB The emergence of global communications networks raises many new questions on the nature of pluralism, community, the delivery of education, the construction of knowledge and the role of comparative educators in a post-Cold War, post-industrialized world. Issues of ownership and power, how knowledge and services are defined and distributed and how technological 'have-nots' are given full and autonomous access to networks will become major policy issues. Educators will need to broaden their perspectives to be more interdisciplinary and knowledgeable of trends and learnings in many different professional and occupation areas if they are to effectively meet the increasing challenges to traditional learning and institutions posed by the new network environment. The author addresses these issues, cites his learning from the rapidly growing area of telemedicine and concludes with recommendations to assist comparative educators address a growing international crisis in education.

DT Article
AB Walking is an important means of local transport, yet it is generally neglected as such despite several major studies produced over the last 20 years.  This article reviews the problems faced by pedestrians, reflecting the way that transport policy only values car travel.  Public authorities in Britain are now starting to address alternative means of travel, but generally they are not looking at the need for environmentally-friendly transport now aimed for in the European Union's Common Transport Policy.  Britain also falls short of the best practice elsewhere in Europe, especially in the Netherlands.  The article draws on experience from the European mainland to recommend principles for developing policies and providing an effective network for pedestrians.

AB This article surveys the topic of entrepreneurship within the processes of regional and local development.  The issue of entrepreneurship is complex, and the interest in it shown by researchers and politicians over the past decade has not made it less so.  Definitional issues which often mark discussions of entrepreneurship are discussed, as are networks of interaction, culture, and local environments.  Policies which attempt to alter regional or local conditions and to promote entrepreneurship and continuing innovation are given attention in the second half of the paper.

AB The rise and fall in the popularity of Britain's inland-waterway system is described, along with the factors which influenced the use of British canals. Present trends in the development and use of large-scale US and European commercial waterway networks are analysed. Recommendations for the increased commercial use of Britain's current (and prospective future) inland-waterway network are presented; the aim being to make a contribution to an integrated, environmentally sustainable, nationwide British transport policy.

TI A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF INTERDISCIPLINARY STRUCTURES IN SCIENCE AND
   TECHNOLOGY - CO-CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS OF ENERGY RESEARCH
SO RESEARCH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID WORD; DISCIPLINARY
AB The wide diversity in subject matter and volume of research publications of large multidisciplinary areas often presents an insurmountable barrier in obtaining a comprehensive overview of its internal ("intellectual") structure. In this article it is shown that a systematic, quantitative examination of the contents of an area's research publications offers an empirical solution for this problem. This "co-classification analysis" is based on the network of interdisciplinary links between research fields contributing to such an area, as manifest in the co-occurrence of different subject-classification headings assigned to research publications. The analysis yields quantitative measures of: (1) the level of interdisciplinarity in contributing research fields; (2) the strength of interdisciplinary relations between these fields, as well as (3) graphical representations ("maps") of the interdisciplinary structure in single fields, as well as the area as a whole.
   Capabilities and limitations of this methodology, as an aid in research policy studies, are discussed by way of a Dutch science-policy-driven application to the area of energy research. Results are presented concerning the worldwide interdisciplinary structure of energy research, and the structure in Dutch publications on research sources of renewable energy. Findings of a subsequent validation study amongst Dutch scientists, R&D managers, and S&T policy makers support our assertion that the method is useful for certain analytical and descriptive purposes, but also point out limits in its range of application.

AB This paper describes ADAPTIVE, a transport system architecture to support multimedia applications for high-speed networks. The ADAPTIVE system applies object-oriented design and implementation techniques to build an integrated framework for protocol specification, composition, prototyping and experimentation. It utilizes a hierarchical specification technique that involves to both the policies of a communication session and the actual mechanisms used to carry out these policies. Its monitoring and analysis facilities provide a rich environment for controlled experimentation through the use of rapid prototyping and integrated instrumentation.

TI DYNAMIC SHORTEST PATHS IN ACYCLIC NETWORKS WITH MARKOVIAN ARC COSTS
SO OPERATIONS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB We examine shortest path problems in acyclic networks in which arc costs are known functions of certain environment variables at network nodes. Each of these variables evolves according to an independent Markov process. The vehicle can wait at a node (at a cost) in anticipation of more favorable arc costs. We first develop two recursive procedures for the individual arc case, one based on successive approximations, and the other on policy iteration. We also solve the same problem via parametric linear programming. We show that the optimal policy essentially classifies the state of the environment variable at a node into two categories: green states for which the optimal action is to immediately traverse the arc, and red states for which the optimal action is to wait. We then extend these concepts for the entire network by developing a dynamic programming procedure that solves the corresponding problem. The complexity of this method is shown to be O(n2K + nK3), where n is the number of network nodes and K is the number of Markov states at each node. We present examples and discuss possible research extensions.

ID ASSIGNMENT
AB In a series of three papers we investigate within an equilibrium framework the magnitude and composition of benefits arising from the various responses of travellers and operators to transport investments. In particular, we determine both analytically in simplified models and numerically in network representations, the extent to which the benefits to generated traffic may be more than off-set by the additional congestion inflicted on other road users. In this paper we adopt a uni-modal network model to appraise a variety of highway schemes and explore the sensitivity of user benefits to: the demand model specification; the inherent elasticity parameters; the level of congestion in a reference network; and the policies selected. The implications of the results for the methods of investment appraisal in urban and nonurban contexts are considered.

TI SEQUENTIAL IMPERFECT PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE POLICIES - A CASE-STUDY

DT Article
ID MINIMAL REPAIR
AB In this paper, two preventive maintenance (PM) policies for the bus engines of a transport network have been considered. Based on the mean time to failure (MTTF) data of the engines of a particular make and model, maintenance policies are developed where the failure rate of the engines does not exceed the pre-determined level of maximum failure rate. In policy 1, the system has a different failure distribution (Weibull) between PMs, and in policy II, each PM reduces the effective age of the system. The number of PM interventions and their schedule times, which minimize the expected mean cost rate over an infinite time horizon for both the policies, have been discussed. Finally, numerical illustrations and the effect of cost factors on the number of PM interventions and the expected cost rates have been presented.

AB In this paper we consider a family of product-form loss models, including loss networks (or circuit-switched communication networks) and a class of resource-sharing models, There can be multiple classes of requests for multiple resources. Requests arrive according to independent Poisson processes. The requests can be for multiple units in each resource (the multi-rate case, e,g, several circuits on a trunk). There can be upper-limit and guaranteed-minimum sharing policies as well as the standard complete-sharing policy, If all the requirements of a request cannot be met upon arrival, then the request is blocked and lost. We develop an algorithm for computing the (exact) steady-state blocking probability of each class and other steady state descriptions in these loss models. The algorithm is based on numerically inverting generating functions of the normalization constants. In a previous paper we introduced this approach to product-form models and developed a full algorithm for a class of closed queueing networks. The inversion algorithm promises to be even more useful for loss models than for closed queueing networks because fewer alternative algorithms are available for loss models. Indeed, for many loss models with sharing policies other than traditional complete sharing, our algorithm is the first effective algorithm. Unlike some recursive algorithms, our algorithm has a low storage requirement. To treat the loss models here, we derive the generating functions of the normalization constants and develop a new scaling algorithm especially tailored to the loss models. In general, the computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of resources, but the computation can often be reduced dramatically by exploiting conditional decomposition based on special structure and by appropriately truncating large finite sums. We illustrate our numerical inversion algorithm by applying it to several examples. To validate our algorithm on small models, we also develop a direct algorithm. The direct algorithm itself is of interest, because it tends to be more efficient when the number of resources is large, but the number of request classes is small. Furthermore, it also allows a form of conditional decomposition based on special structure.

AB The environment in which federal agencies, libraries, other information providers, and users are operating is one of rapid change. These institutions, agencies, libraries, and providers:face similar pressures. It is a time to maintain current services with increasing budget pressures and shifting priorities. It is a time of transition to networked-based services with the concurrent delivery of, or expectation of, ongoing information services. Finally, it is a time that all stakeholders understand, indeed they are clamoring for a rethinking of government information dissemination programs, albeit from different perspectives, yet in reaction to similar or common pressures. A review of some of the pressures on the federal information dissemination system is presented in addition to descriptions of some innovative collaborative partnerships that are forming in response to the call for change in information dissemination policies and practices.

TI TRANSPORTATION AND REGIONAL AGGLOMERATION IN JAPAN - THROUGH A LONG-TERM
   SIMULATION-MODEL 1920-85
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The present article reviews the effects of wartime and post-war policies on regional agglomeration of landuse and transportation activities in Japan. For this purpose the authors have formulated a long-term model over the period 1920-85, and conducted its final test. After confirming the accuracy of the entire model, it is used to evaluate the wartime policies which caused excessive employment agglomeration in Tokyo, and post-war policies concerning the high speed Shinkansen rail network. We conclude that the choices of alternative policies would have led to a more balanced regional structure than there is now, with less agglomeration in both Tokyo and the Kanto region.

TI Fuzzy learning decomposition for the scheduling of hydroelectric power

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TERM
AB paper presents a nonlinear multivariable fitting model to decompose the optimal policies obtained by dynamic programming of a unique aggregated reservoir. The nonlinear functions are generated using radial basis functions (RBF) neural networks. In this method the potential energy of all the reservoirs in the hydropower system is added to form one equivalent reservoir. The operating policy of the equivalent reservoir is determined by stochastic dynamic programming, and finally the operating rules of each reservoir are determined using RBF neural networks. To improve the multivariable representation of the data, a series of piecewise RBF neural networks is determined using clustering analysis. A fuzzy clustering approach is used to determine the RBF's parameters. This approach has the advantages of being fast and simple to implement with well-established convergence properties. It also has a good representation of the covariance matrix, since all the data belong to all the classes at the same time with different membership grades. A comparison with the back propagation learning and principal components techniques is also reported for Quebec's La Grande River installations. As a result, the proposed approach gives satisfactory operating rules compared with principal component analysis, and the CPU time is reduced by a factor of 15 to 20 compared with the back propagation technique.

AB This paper describes the objectives for and concepts of Trans-European transport networks, from the viewpoint of the European Commission. The objective of the policy of the trans-European networks is to create a ''polymodal'' approach, i.e., one that involves all modes of transport, combined transport being one such mode. The paper addresses financing schemes for such networks. Possible schemes involving Central and East European countries are also considered. Finally, some transport tunnels located onpriority axes are mentioned.

AB Transport policies can have significant impacts on the environment. This work analyses the extent to which some policies and future trends would influence local levels of air pollution concentration in an urban area. The analysis is based on the application of a road traffic assignment model, in conjunction with an air pollution dispersion model, to the urban road network of Chester, England. The former model simulates the traffic flow conditions, whereas the latter estimates the concentration of five main traffic pollutants at receptor points around road junctions. Actual vehicle exhaust emission rates are input into the dispersion model, as a function of fuel type, fitting of catalytic converters and typical driving operating patterns. Changes in pollutant concentrations are estimated from the implementation of a pedestrianisation scheme in the central area. Furthermore, the effects of traffic growth and the increasing participation of diesels and catalysts in the vehicle market are analysed.

AB This paper presents the results of a comparative study of interorganizational networks, or systems, of mental health delivery in four U.S. cities, leading to a preliminary theory of network effectiveness. Extensive data were collected from surveys, interviews, documents, and observations. Network effectiveness was assessed by collecting and aggregating data on outcomes from samples of clients, their families, and their case managers at each site. Results of analyses of both quantitative and qualitative data collected at the individual, organizational, and network levels of analysis showed that network effectiveness could be explained by various structural and contextual factors, specifically, network integration, external control, system stability, and environmental resource munificence. Based on the findings, we develop testable propositions to guide theory development and future research on network effectiveness.

TI DELAY BOUNDS ON A QUEUING SYSTEM WITH CONSISTENT PRIORITIES
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB A discrete-time queueing system operating under a two-level, consistent priority service policy is studied in this paper. The consistency of the policy guarantees that no low priority customer will be served before a previously (or simultaneously) arrived high priority one. Unlike the well known head of the line priority policy (which is consistent), the considered policy provides for limited service to low priority customers, even in the presence of high priority ones. The proposed policy may be viewed as a consistent version of the straightforward gated/limited service priority policy. It may also be viewed as a compromise between the head of the line priority policy and the straightforward gated/limited priority service policy. The customer service time is assumed to be deterministic and equal to one time unit, which makes the queueing model applicable to a packetized communication network environment; potential relevant applications are presented. Based on renewal arguments, the theory of infinite dimensional linear equations and a work-conservation law, a general methodology is developed for the derivation of arbitrarily tight bounds on the induced mean packet delay.

TI MISSING NETWORKS IN EUROPEAN TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper reports on missing networks in Europe's transport and communication infrastructure. Starting from the keyrole of infrastructure for economic development, it is argued that unless urgent action is taken to fill the gaps they threaten to reduce seriously the competitive advantages that will be gained from the single European market. Six examples of missing networks are presented in this study. They relate to combined freight transport, the European airline system, high-speed rail networks, European common carriage, inland waterways and telecommunication. The logic behind these missing networks is discussed and it is concluded that the problems can only be solved if one has a pentagon of concerns, rather than just a one- or two-dimensional infrastructure planning policy.

TI Evaluating information flows to policy committees instate legislatures -
   Forest and natural resources as a case
SO EVALUATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Using forest and natural resources as a case example, the information needs of 47 policy committee staff from 35 state legislatures were evaluated. Staff communicate with various groups on a regular-routine basis, an incident-related basis, and on a confidential basis. A state's lead forest resource agency and environmental groups were viewed as especially important formulators of policies and programs. To maintain the integrity of information provided, four fifths of the surveyed staff fairly or very often check with alternative sources. Legislative staff play especially important roles in focusing information, providing access to multiple sources, integrating information establishing trustworthy networks, structuring legislator requests, and differentiating among groups' ability to provide information appropriate to specific policy development stages.

AB This article uses organization theory and political economy to develop a conceptual framework for analyzing factors that shape relations between government agencies and their social environment. The framework conceptualizes these relations as social networks composed of actors engaged in the exchange of resources. Then, it develops an understanding of how cultural norms shape these exchanges. The article concludes by examining the framework's normative implications. In particular, it explores when agency autonomy promotes effective policy implementation and when it results in unaccountability. It also demonstrates that, in many cases, an agency's dependence on actors in its environment may enhance the effectiveness of policy implementation.

TI Review of agency arrangements for trunk roads and motorways - A local

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER
LA English
DT Review
AB Since the 1940s, the Department of Transport has appointed agents to manage, maintain and improve the network on the Secretary of State's behalf, Although these 'agency agreements' are generally with local highway authorities, since the mid-1980s the policy has been to increase opportunities for the private sector to participate in this work, This was effected initially through separate agency agreements, followed by design, build, finance and operate schemes and finally through new arrangements of agencies and agreements for which the private and public sectors can compete, This paper describes these changes in policy and documents local authorities' concerns as to their effects on the management of the highway network and the general public.

DE infrastructure; telecommunications; information; organizational capital
AB Recent research on infrastructure investment has focused on a narrow public sector version including transportation facilities, water and sewer lines and communication systems, in part because of measurement problems. Policy debate and popular discussion have taken the same track, infrastructure proving a powerful metaphor, especially in its advertising manifestations, while being a nebulous and overworked construct.
   A wider view brackets roads, bridges and ports with, for example, property rights. The OECD definition takes in an economic category of networked services and a social category of facilities that provide community services such as education, health and leisure, and law and order.
   In the case of telecommunications, customers are presented with a patchwork of interconnected, but not fully inter-operable, transmission networks. Research and debate tend to fall short of the expansive NTIA meaning of infrastructure that included fully integrated physical components, information itself, applications and software, network standards and transmission codes, and the people involved.
   If infrastructure includes what has been found necessary to the functioning of the economy, there are major omissions: e.g. information stocks; organizational capital; and human capital. Unlike Marx and Engels, we do have ''the time, the place [and] the opportunity to allow for the other elements involved in the interaction to come into their rights''.
   There are implications for inter-operability:
   Research findings of declining public sector infrastructure are misleading as investment in the other elements, by both public and private sectors, must be examined.
   Significant complementarities are ignored.
   Significant sequences or lags between economic actions are ignored.
   Potential productivity gains and growth rates generally are overstated and funding requirements understated.
   Management tasks and policy processes are too narrowly conceived.
   Consumers' surplus derives from the complex combination of technical, economic, social and legal conditions.

TI PERFORMANCE OF CONNECTION MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR A LAN TO BROAD-BAND

SO IFIP TRANSACTIONS C-COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORKS; OSI
AB We consider the problem of connecting LANs via ISDN link which are connection-oriented in nature. Data exchange between a pair of gateways is possible only after establishing an ISDN connection between these gateways. It is assumed that LAN endsystems support a connection Oriented transport protocol on top of the connectionless Internetwork Protocol which does not provide the gateway with any indications when to open and close the ISDN connection. Thus there appears a need for some specific policy for ISDN connection management. We present a systematic investigation of the connection management strategies for a case study: a gateway BERGATE designed and developed within a pilot broadband ISDN implementation BERKOM supported by the German PTT. Assuming that the ISDN interface allows only a single connection, we investigate the performance of a simple connection management policy, select proper values of parameters for this policy, and demonstrate that this policy performs only marginally worse than an ideal policy using full information about the state of transport connections.

TI POLICY RESPONSES TO STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DEPLETION
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB A study of the collective regulation of chemicals which threaten the stratospheric ozone layer sheds light on the questions of how states recognize problems which had not previously been clearly indicated, the politics of actual standard setting, and the role of scientific understanding.  Costly choices have been made without absolute scientific confirmation of environmental risk.  This process was driven by the interplay of three interrelated sets of forces:  knowledge, international politics, and technological innovation.  Each may be necessary but insufficient to explain the outcome.  Key in this case has been the role of an ecological epistemic community - a knowledge-based transnational network of specialists - whose members shared common views about the causes of the phenomenon and the policies which should be taken to manage it.  This group was largely responsible for identifying and popularizing the problem's existence, and for selecting policy choices for its management.

ID SPOT MARKET; POWER
AB What are the likely consequences of introducing competition in the Danish electricity supply? Production and trade must be separated from the distribution network, which is still considered a natural monopoly. The main regulatory task will be to secure access on equal terms for competing suppliers. The Danish producers of combined heat and power can compete on an international market, and the existence of low cost producers in the other Nordic countries should make such a market contestable. Competition offers good opportunities for reducing the social costs of the Danish energy policy without lowering its ambitions.

TI INNOVATION, NETWORKS, AND VERTICAL INTEGRATION
SO RESEARCH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB A central debate in industrial policy today is that between proponents of large vertically integrated firms on the one hand and those of networks of small specialized producers on the other. This paper argues that neither institutional structure is the panacea its supporters claim. The menu of institutional alternatives is in fact quite large, and both firms and networks, of which there are several kinds, can be successful, growth-promoting adaptations to the competitive environment. Industrial structures vary in their ability to coordinate information flows necessary for innovation and to overcome power relationships adverse to innovation. The relative desirability of the various structures, then, depends on the nature and scope of technological change in the industry and on the effects of various product life-cycle patterns. The principal policy conclusion of this analysis is that the government's role ought to be facilitating rather than narrow and prescriptive, allowing scope for firms to develop organizational forms that are best adapted to their particular environments.

AB Local area networks (LANs) have become indispensable in today's highly competitive business environment. A LAN connects multiple file servers for many concurrent information retrievals. The system administrator has to resolve two allocation problems, workload and data. The allocation decisions are interrelated; a transaction is routed to the server that contains the data items requested. Affinity-based workload allocation is employed, and the database is thus fragmented into data files that are allocated across multiple servers. The paper's two primary objectives are (i) to provide a rationale for workload and data allocation and (ii) to present an analytical model which will attain effective allocation policies. The integrated problem is presented in the form of a nonlinear zero-one integer program. A special structure of the problem is employed to demonstrate the complexity of the problem, and to propose an algorithm.

AB Rural telecommunication networks can foster the development of needed infrastructures for rural residents in an economically viable way. Thanks to emerging broadband fiber optics technology, rural telecommunications can be established via hub cities that function as service centers for neighboring smaller rural areas. Determining hub locations typically requires trade-offs among conflicting criteria. Policy makers typically set their goals as target values. The main aim of this paper is to present a zero-one compromise programming model that reflects such policy makers' target-setting behavior under a multiple criteria environment. A case in which the model is applied to the location of hub telecommunication centers in an American state further illustrates the applicability of the method.

   WATER PROGRAM (RCWP)
AB Demonstrating water quality improvements from nonpoint source (NPS) controls by monitoring both land treatment and water quality in at least a subset of watershed projects is necessary to provide feedback to project coordinators Feedback to regional and national policy makers is also essential to achieve political and economic support for NPS control programs. To meet this objective, two challenges must be met in designing the monitoring network and analyzing the data: (1) Detecting significant (or real) trends in both water quality and land treatment implementation and (2) Associating water quality trends with land treatment trends.
   Land treatment and water quality monitoring requirements for meeting these challenges are discussed based on lessons learned from the Rural Clean Water Program, a 10-15 year experimental program designed to control agricultural NPS pollution in rural watersheds. At minimum, monitoring of land treatment and water quality should be multi-year before and after best management practice (BMP) implementation. The paired watershed design is the best for documenting BMP effectiveness in the shortest number of years (a minimum of 3-5 years). The water quality and land treatment data bases should be temporally related. All significant sources of variability in the land treatment and water quality data should be taken into account to increase the chances of isolating true water quality changes due to BMPs.

TI THE DEVELOPMENT OF 2 DEPHOSPHATING TECHNOLOGIES - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY OF
   FACTORS INFLUENCING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
SO JOURNAL OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA) has been proposed as a strategic tool for technology policy.  In order to have an influence on technological development, one must first understand its dynamics.  This is especially pressing in the field of environmental pollution.  In the Dutch National Environmental Policy Plan (NEPP, NMP) one important strategy for the reduction of pollution is the development of new technologies that meet stricter environmental standards.  These environmental standards can be met either by further developing existing technological trajectories, or by developing and implementing alternative trajectories.  The technological dynamics of both the hastening of the development of existing trajectories, and the development of alternatives, are not completely understood.
   We use a recently proposed scheme as an analytical tool for the analysis of decision making on technological developments.  The scheme includes three dimensions:  the technology, the structure of the firm's internal network, and its external (market and non-market) relationships.  We use this approach for the analysis of two recently developed dephosphating technologies in the Netherlands.  These technologies have been stimulated by environmental government policy measures.
   The first technology, the "pellet reactor," is a fluid bed process.  The carrier is sand on which calcium phosphate crystalizes at certain process conditions.  The second technology, "magnetic dephosphating," operates by adding magnetite to the waste water.  At certain process conditions the phosphate is removed as calcium phosphate by magnetic force.

ID BALANCE
AB The European Union is faced with major environmental problems related to nitrogen (N) compounds. The origins of three such problems, the atmospheric deposition of N compounds, the leaching of nitrates to ground-water and the anthropogenic N-input to the North Sea, are investigated by means of a Substance Flow Analysis (SFA); the reference year is 1988. Although the problems occur at various scales and have varying direct causes, food production and consumption together are the main responsible sectors, and the production and import of fertilizer appear to be the major ultimate sources in all three cases. Measures to combat these problems have been agreed to in various international frameworks: the European Community, the International North Sea Conference and the Rhine States Conference. These measures include technical emission reduction for acidifying compounds resulting in a 30% emission reduction; extension of the sewage treatment network and application of denitrification with 50% effectiveness; and introduction of measures directed at efficiency increase and emission reduction in agricultural practice in 10% of the agricultural area. The recent changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are not expected to lead to significant changes in N flows. Assuming full implementation, an almost sufficient 45% reduction is expected for the anthropogenic nitrogen input into the North Sea. The atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds will be reduced by approximately 20%. The leaching of nitrates to the ground-water is expected to remain at the current level or even to increase a little. In all, these measures are conducive to solving, but do not satisfactorily solve, the three problems, mainly because the ultimate origins of the problems are not sufficiently influenced and measures therefore inevitably result in a shifting of problems.

TI EPAS APPROACH TO VADOSE ZONE MONITORING AT RCRA FACILITIES
SO GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed to amend federal regulations to require vadose zone monitoring at certain hazardous waste facilities. To support this proposal, EPA evaluated previous policy on vadose zone monitoring and examined advances in vadose zone monitoring technology. Changes in EPA vadose zone monitoring policy were driven by demonstrated advances in the available monitoring technology and improvements in understanding of vadose zone processes. When used under the appropriate conditions, currently available direct and indirect monitoring methods can effectively detect contamination that may leak from hazardous waste facilities into the vadose zone. Direct techniques examined include soil-core monitoring and soil-pore liquid monitoring. Indirect techniques examined include soil-gas monitoring, neutron moderation, complex resistivity, ground-penetrating radar, and electrical resistivity. Properly designed vadose zone monitoring networks can act as a complement to saturated zone monitoring networks at numerous hazardous waste facilities. At certain facilities, particularly those in arid climates where the saturated zone is relatively deep, effective vadose zone monitoring may allow a reduction in the scope of saturated zone monitoring programs.

AB 1. The foundations of our understanding of acid deposition were laid in the last century, but the scale and scope of damage to sensitive receptors has only been subject to intensive investigation over the last 30 years or so. Negotiations are now well underway to reduce emissions, and for some pollutants policy is in place, so that these receptors may be protected adequately. Crucial to this has been the 'critical loads' approach adopted in the U.K. and elsewhere in Europe over the last 6 years.
   2. This paper describes the source of acidic emissions, how these emissions are transformed in the atmosphere and subsequently deposited. Measurements of wet deposition are made at a number of sites in the U.K. and some of the results from the networks are presented. These results allow wet and dry deposition to be mapped and the methodologies and underlying assumptions to these procedures are described, and S deposition has been estimated for the U.K. Acid Waters Monitoring Network sites.

DE POLICY ANALYSIS; THINK-TANKS; COMMUNITY OR
AB Prior analysis of the implications of public policy initiatives is commonly quite inadequate, and spectacularly so in recent government history.  There has been a retreat from reason in public affairs.  Until now Operational Research has largely failed to address or be applied to issues in the public policy domain.  However, the new generation of problem structuring methods offers forms of analysis well suited to the environment in which public policy is formed.  The quality of public debate would be much enhanced by a wider dissemination of analytic support.  Cabinets, Parliamentary Committees, political parties, and a wide range of community-based groups could benefit in this way.  A network of think-tanks and research institutes, whose inter-disciplinary basis would incorporate operational research, is proposed to provide the requisite analytic capability.

ID STRATEGIES
AB This paper considers the issue of local economic policy in an industrial district. We focus on the fashion system in Nottingham's Lace Market as an example of a flexibly specialised production complex whose success hinges on the production of quality, design based garments produced in small batches to meet customised consumption preferences. Such flexibility is enhanced through integrated local supply chains within a networking community of firms, and is underpinned by the provision of a sophisticated system of collective services. Our aim is to explore the role which institutional regulation has played in sustaining this industrial quarter, focusing on the complex relationship between economic activity, policy and place. While state intervention has played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of this industrial agglomeration, this study also clearly reveals the tensions inherent within economic development policies which simultaneously endeavour to satisfy commercial, conservation, industrial and environmental interests. We conclude by offering the basis for a policy agenda which could enhance economic adjustment within an industrial district.

AB Satellite communication is a radio-based technique that has been present in Europe since the mid 1970s. Historically, it has been used to provide long-distance telephony; particularly trans-Atlantic traffic. In recent years satellites have been used extensively for television broadcasting and specialised business communications. Too often organisations operating in Europe find they must pay high prices for communicating by satellite and there are obstacles to exploiting their full potential; particularly across national frontiers. This article states there are two fundamental reasons for this: policy and regulatory impediments and long-standing institutional relationships. It looks at reform initiatives, ONP, network interconnection arrangements, VSATs and the ISOs.

ID TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; TRIP DISTRIBUTION
AB Travel demand analyses are useful for transportation planning and policy development in a study area. However, travel demand modeling faces two obstacles. First, standard practice solves the four travel components (trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and network assignment) in a sequential manner. This can result in inconsistencies and non-convergence. Second, the data required are often complex and difficult to manage. Recent advances in formal methods for network equilibrium-based travel demand modeling and computational platforms for spatial data handling can overcome these obstacles. In this paper we report on the development of a prototype geographic information system (GIS) design to support network equilibrium-based travel demand models. The GIS design has several key features, including: (i) realistic representation of the multimodal transportation network, (ii) increased likelihood of database integrity after updates, (iii) effective user interfaces, and (iv) efficient implementation of network equilibrium solution algorithms.

AB Theories on technology development often assume technology as a given. Some scholars, notably Langdon Winner, argue that technology is itself a political artifact. This paper tries to operationalize such a techno-political view on ICT development. In this view, technology is not seen as an autonomous development, but it acknowledges that technology does matter with respect to the environment it creates. The key propositions underlying such a view are, first, that ICT projects are characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity, which means that they are open to various interpretations. Secondly, they take place in policy networks in which the actors have to sort out their differences via a political process. Two Electronic Data Interchange projects are described and analyzed to illustrate this view. The analyses underscore the importance of further development of a techno-political view on ICT development.

AB The paper begins with a case study of CORPORATION X, a small global corporation which specializes in the production and sale of brand-name textile and apparel goods. CORPORATION X is a real company but emphasis is placed on the logical implications of its structure and organization for the theory of the firm and regional development in the western Pacific. The entrepreneurial and coordination functions of CORPORATION X are located at its centre but it purchases many of its design, production, transportation and wholesale/retail services from agents and subcontractors around the globe. CORPORATION X is made-up of an extended chain-of-links; it is, in effect, a spatially elongated production system. The paper suggests that the company's commitment to any subcontracting source (and hence the region in which that subcontractor is located) depends upon the relative costs and prices of a subcontractor (compared to other opportunities for the provision of comparable services), the relative contribution of a subcontractor to total value (compared to other parts in the chain-of-links) and the temporal dependence of the firm on the subcontractor given the nature of the service provided. Also considered are two limits to globalization. One limit is the problem of corporate governance. The second limit is financial risk assessment and management.

AB Much has changed in television since the 1970s, when most studies examining the content of advertising to children were conducted. An altered regulatory climate and changes in the industry structure (e.g., growth of cable and independent stations) suggest the need to reexamine the characteristics of such messages. This study assessed the nature and number of commercials during children's programs on three different types of channels: broadcast networks, independent stations, and cable networks. Clear patterns of differences were found across the various channel types. The broadcast networks provided the greatest amount of advertising; cable presented significantly less. Independent stations captured the largest share of toy ads. Cable presented the widest range of products advertised, including such new categories as recorded telephone messages targeting children. The study also examined the themes/appeals employed in the commercials, disclosures/disclaimers used, and other content attributes of the advertising.

SO CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL

DT Article
AB This article analyses how physicians choose locations of practice in response to spatial competition forces and considers the implications of such choices for public policy to alleviate shortages of practitioners in rural areas. The predicted geographic distribution of physicians, as determined through spatial competition modelling, was compared with the actual distribution of physicians in 1990 among Alberta's 19 census divisions. Physicians were found to respond to spatial competition forces in choosing where to practise, with the qualification that 1 urban patient had a demand weight equal to 2.32 rural patients. A policy to attract more physicians to rural areas by means of income subsidies is technically feasible but expensive. The high cost means that alternative policies such as a bigger and more effective ambulance network to transport patients to medical centres should become the focus of public policies to improve health care in rural areas.

AB Combined heat and power with district (i.e. community) heating (CHP-DH) has had or will have, a significant and increasing role in dictating the energy strategies for most European countries. It has been, and still is, the desired policy that heating bills are based on actual consumption. For example, Denmark, a pioneering country in implementing DH and which already has a greater number of DH customers per head of population than any other country, has for long been concerned with metering. In the current investigation, the performance of a selection of heat meters are compared. In addition, methods of preventing fouling in different flow units are described.

   FAST RESPONSE NETWORKS
AB A growing problem for many organizations is spiraling telecommunications costs coupled with the need to respond faster to changing market conditions.  To handle such a situation, TRW's Space and Defense Sector management authorized a new integrated voice and data digital network for 20,000 employees located in 65 buildings.  TRW's top management saw the network as an opportunity to integrate the company's islands of information, which were isolated within separate data networks.  The project took four and one half years from design to implementation at a cost of $45 million.  The management techniques employed resulted in critical milestones being met not only on time but also 10 percent under the original budget.  The new network provided a single access mechanism that resulted in some unanticipated advantages that went beyond the original goals of fast response and cost containment.  The network successfully addressed such problems as developing effective data networking policies, network sizing in a multi-vendor environment, sharing excess information system capacity, centralizing the network while keeping the information systems decentralized, and overcoming the "not controlled here" syndrome.  TRW's experiences should prove valuable for large information-intensive companies attempting to meet similar challenges.

AB The effectiveness of optimal bus policy for dealing with fuel consumption in urban areas under different hypotheses of car pricing is investigated, The transport system of autos and buses is modelled as set of modes in equilibrium where bus service is provided with the objective of maximizing fuel savings over the whole of the road network and where car pricing is exogenously imposed by local authority. Results of a case study show that policies based on frequency, fare, and bus size alone have negligible effectiveness unless they are supported by car pricing measures. Also, the strong sensitivity of optimal bus operating parameters with respect to the time-to-fare elasticity ratio of demand is highlighted.

AB We formulate the Forest Management Problem as a Multicommodity Network Flow Problem with a convex cost function, We then show how to transfer the problem to an equivalent Single-Commodity Network Flow formulation in order to address several sensitivity analysis questions using results by Granot and Veinott (1985). The answers can subsequently be used to help forest managers respond to changes in the environment such as fires or changes in market prices, without any additional computation. Furthermore, the characterization of the response we provide requires no prior knowledge of optimal management policies.

TI Developing assessment techniques for statewide electronic networks
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASIS ANNUAL MEETING
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION
AB As more states invest in statewide electronic networks, questions concerning the selection and configuration of appropriate network technologies, the appropriate types and levels of services to provide over such networks, the means through which to govern these networks, and the development of methodologies to evaluate the impact of these networks are key concerns to a wide range of network stakeholder and constituency groups. Increasingly, state and local government policy making officials, as well as citizens, are asking questions -- not about whether their governments should invest in electronic networks -- but about ways in which to maximize the benefits and impacts of existing and/or evolving networking initiatives.
   This paper reports on a study in progress designed to address these, and other questions related to assessing statewide electronic network initiatives by using the Maryland Sailor network as a case study. The purpose of this study is to develop assessment techniques and indicators for the evaluation of statewide electronic networks. In addition, this paper defines key components of the statewide networked environment and develops and operationalizes performance measures for networked information technologies and services provided through statewide networks.
   The paper suggests that developing assessment techniques for statewide electronic networks is a multidimensional process due to the complex technological and behavioral nature of electronic networks. The paper explores several methods through which to evaluate statewide electronic networks, and identifies and discusses key issues and preliminary findings that affect the successful evaluation of statewide networked services.

AB This article highlights the importance of housing and transportation networks in a development process with special emphasis on economic development efforts at the national and regional levels. The major characteristics and developmental aspects of housing and transportation are presented first. Then, legislative policies of the United States are used as examples of successful efforts in the development of these two infrastructures followed by brief explanations of those policies as they relate to development of housing and transportation in that country. Because an economic development effort usually signifies a need characterized by very limited capital, particularly in developing countries or in former nations of the eastern bloc, special attention is focused on financial mechanisms used in policy implementation.

TI Minimum inventory variability schedule with applications in
   semiconductor fabrication
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING
LA English
DT Letter
AB A typical semiconductor wafer fab contains many different products and processes, some with small quantities, competing for resources. Each product flow can contain hundreds of processing steps demanding production time of the same resource many times during the flow. When this re-entry requirement is compounded with multiple product flows, short interval scheduling becomes important. Scheduling to reduce variations and to balance the whole wafer production line becomes a very complex issue.
   We investigate in this paper a new scheduling policy called minimum inventory variability scheduling (MIVS). This scheduling policy can significantly reduce the mean and variance of cycle-time in semiconductor fabs.
   The conclusions are based on the real world implementation in two major semiconductor fabs since 1990, and a simulation study of a much simplified hypothetical re-entrant network to capture the nature of semiconductor manufacturing. A discrete event simulation model was used to compare MIVS with five different popular dispatching policies (FIFO, SNQ, LNQ, RAN, and CYC) practiced in wafer fabrication environments. The results gained on two factory floors and the simulation model indicate that dispatching policies have a significant impact on performance. The simulation results show that the MIVS dispatching policy demonstrated a percentage improvement over all other tested dispatching policies.

AB This paper discusses and evaluate a high speed multimedia communications in ATM networks. Communication platforms below AAL layer in ATM networks can provide fairly high speed communication channel for ATM-UNI. On the other hand, the conventional data processing architecture in the workstations can not provide sufficient throughput compared to the throughput of ATM networks at this time. Also, regarding error-free peer-to-peer data communications, conventional transport protocol, e.g. TCP, can not provide small latent communication, when the product of communication bandwidth and propagation delay is large. This paper focuses on protocol architecture, especially on error control policy at SSCS in AAL layer, and on performance evaluation of high speed multimedia communication based on the current data processing architecture.

AB This paper addresses the development and implementation of a ''controller'' for a single manufacturing machine. This prototype will serve as an important tool to study the integration of several functions and the utilization of status data to evaluate scheduling and control decision alternatives. The emphasis is on creating a prediction capability to aid in assessing the long-term system performance impact resulting from decisions made and environmental changes. This prediction capability is implemented by using neural networks, simulation, and generic algorithms. Neural networks predict the behavior of different sequencing policies available in the system. The contribution of the genetic algorithms to the decision-making process is the development of a ''new'' scheduling rule based on a ''building blocks'' procedure initiated by the neural networks.

AB The development of knowledge within industries is strongly influenced by the network structure of relations among firms. Firms relying on localized knowledge can implement their technological capability not only by means of research and development expenditures and internal learning but also through the systematic absorption of technological and scientific externalities available in their environment. Percolation processes have been studied in physics as the outcome of two classes of forces termed as connectivity and receptivity. The former measures the number of connections in place among the agents in the network and the latter the capability of each agent to absorb the informations received. This paper applies the methodology of percolation processes to operationalize the implications for both the economics of innovation and for technology policy of the structural characteristics of innovation networks as communication systems.

TI GROUNDWATER-QUALITY MONITORING - EFFECTIVE METHOD OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL
   SYSTEM POLLUTION PREVENTION
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY AND WATER SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Groundwater-quality monitoring plays an important role in groundwater protection and quality conservation.  National, regional, and site-specific monitoring programs operating in Czechoslovakia concern collection of background data on groundwater quality and regional diffusion pollution problems.  Site-specific monitoring is concerned with point sources of pollution.  Pilot monitoring stations with automatic data acquisition systems optimize monitoring methods, design of monitoring networks, sampling techniques, and frequency and selection of the variables analyzed.  Ground-water-quality monitoring in Czechoslovakia supports decision and policy making in areas of intensive farming.  Time and spatial changes in shallow vulnerable aquifers are evaluated in several areas of national territory and support integrated land-use planning and groundwater protection management.

TI THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF CANADIAN TRANSPORTATION AID POLICY
SO REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES DU DEVELOPPEMENT-CANADIAN JOURNAL OF
   DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB All societies must organize the surface on which they operate. This practice produces a network of circulation that characterizes the geographic environment. Obviously, the physical barriers to movement over space have to be reduced to a minimum. Indeed, the conquest of distance is so fundamental to geography that development cannot occur without movement. Distance can be measured in terms of time and cost, and an emphasis on distance is an emphasis on extent. Indeed, the distance reached provides a record of the extent to which a society has shaped terrestrial space and, in so doing, has shaped itself. Recent projections call for an increased transfer of transportation aid to Third World countries where diversity, distances and population growth accentuate problems of transportation and generate obstacles to the mobilization of resources for development. This paper first examines the problems and the transportation needs of Third World countries, notably landlocked countries. The Canadian response is then examined with particular attention to the characteristics, the evolution and the magnitude of transportation aid. The article concludes on an evaluation of the Canadian transportation aid policy in the context of recent policy changes.

AB This paper reviews the Singapore government's strategic approach toward the development of an electronic trading environment which aims to create opportunities to benefit from the increasing globalisation of trade. It is suggested that both universal access to advanced telecommunication services and a new generation of 'network-based' institutions are necessary preconditions for the success of this strategy. The authors review Singapore's experience in developing new institutional solutions in response to the challenge to create an advanced electronic trading environment in the ASEAN region as well as in the wider global economy.

TI STABILITY ANALYSIS OF LOAD BALANCING SYSTEMS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
AB A load processor is a system that has a buffer which can receive load and store it while it is waiting to be processed and has a local decision-making policy for determining if portions of its load should be sent to other load processors. A load balancing system is a set of such load processors that are connected in a network so that (i) they can sense the amount of load in the buffers of neighbouring processors and pass load to them, and (ii) so that, via local information and decisions by the individual load processors, the overall load in the entire network can be balanced. Such balancing is important to ensure that certain processors are not overloaded while others are left idle (i.e. load balancing helps avoid underutilization of processing resources). The topology of the network, delays in transporting and sensing load, types of load, and types of local load passing policies all affect the performance of the load balancing system. In this paper, we show how a variety of load balancing systems can be modelled in a discrete event system (DES) theoretic framework, and how balancing properties and performance can be characterized and analysed in a general Lyapunov stability theoretic framework.

ID KARAKORAM
AB The internationalization of global issues has become quite familiar in the sphere of ecological problems with impact on the earth's conditions of survival. Development related aspects are now incorporated into a discussion of sustainability in which issues such as global governance, structural adjustment programs for aid-receiving economies, and control measures for migration play a prominent role. In a holistic approach towards sustainable development the interrelationship of environment and economy needs to be stressed and simultaneously the time scale of socio-political transformation needs to be considered. These developments affect high mountain areas of Third World countries in a similar manner to other peripheral regions. This paper focuses on four aspects connected with development issues in high mountain regions which are exemplified for Northern Pakistan: the function of international boundaries; the governance of conflicts on local administration; the impact of road access on regional development; and the effects of external interests such as tourism and conservation of nature on local socioeconomic conditions.
   These aspects have been selected to show the complexity of international relations, the high degree of integration into the world market system experienced by marginal regions, and the minority position of mountain people in this network Along these lines the hypothesis is substantiated that an analysis of interest conflicts, exchange patterns, and regional disparities is required in order to understand the present development processes in remote mountain regions of the Developing World.

AB This paper focuses on high-speed connection-oriented communication among high-end multitasking systems. This environment is characterized by very high interconnection bandwidth and by large, variable size data blocks. The HIPPI standard is being designed to provide a base for communication in such an environment. Multitasking in members of the system complex requires multiple source buffers for the interconnection system, an unusual feature of connection-oriented communication that requires special consideration in the design and performance evaluation. We define two connection management policies, the centralized and the broadcast policy and two service disciplines, the ALL discipline and the FIFO discipline. We then develop analytic models that can represent the salient features of such interconnection systems, including, the management policy, the service discipline and the number of buffers. The models are validated by comparing their results to results from simulations. The models are then used to evaluate the impact of the connection management policies, the service disciplines, and the number of buffers on the performance of these interconnection systems.

AB In a companion paper the concept of system vulnerability is introduced as a new framework for power system dynamic security assessment. Using the TEF method of transient stability analysis, the energy margin DELTAV is used as an indicator of the level of security, and its sensitivity to a changing system parameter p (partial derivative DELTAV/partial derivative p) as indicator of its trend with changing system conditions. These two indicators are combined to determine the degree of system vulnerability to contingent disturbances in a stability-limited power system. Thresholds for acceptable levels of the security indicator and its trend are related to the stability limits of a critical system parameter (plant generation limits). Operating practices and policies are used to determine these thresholds.
   In this paper the artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique is applied to the concept of system vulnerability within the recently developed framework, for fast pattern recognition and classification of system dynamic security status. A suitable topology for the neural network is developed, and the appropriate training method and input and output signals are selected.
   The procedure developed is successfully applied to the IEEE 50-generator test system. Data previously obtained by heuristic techniques are used for training the ANN.

AB Within a few months of its founding in 1870, the tradition of science-based advocacy in the American Fisheries Society (AFS) was established. The American Fish Culturist's Association, as it was then called, lodged protests with the U.S. State Department and Canada against obstructions in the St. Lawrence River that restricted the migration of salmon. Prompt response was obtained. In addition to resource advocacy, as a professional society our mission encompasses scientific development and professional service objectives. Throughout its history the Society has done an excellent job of building fisheries science through gathering and disseminating information, recognizing educational, scientific, and technical accomplishments, and establishing standards for the fisheries profession. The result of our science-based advocacy has been less distinguished-we have documented the decline of fish populations and the loss of supporting fish habitats as human population expansion and attendant resource development has occurred. In recognition of this failure, 92% of the Society's membership surveyed in 1986 gave medium or high priority to more active participation by AFS in developing environmental policy. The Society has since increased its advocacy and lobbying activities. We support agency fishery program budgets, develop legislation, and comment on legislative initiatives of others. We have formed a coalition of fishermen to conserve habitat; sponsored the Mississippi Interjurisdictional Cooperative Resources Agreement; and launched the Fisheries Action Network. We recognize that if AFS is to participate in bringing about a reversal of the declines cited above, the Society must put scientific facts into a context of environmental ethics and shared community values to effectively and clearly communicate the fishery consequences of decisions on the management of land and water resources.

AB How do the librarians in the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) plan to perform a role in the electronic environment? Depository librarians must meet the challenge of changing how they think about government information libraries and their mission in order to provide citizen access services in an electronic environment. The new mission is to connect the user with information at the time of need, to instruct citizens in gaining access to government information, and to develop networking applications and programs that will help to put valuable content in the information infrastructure. If the FDLP and depository libraries are to prepare to perform that role, librarians need to take stock of their technological environment, deal with the political realities, and be critical of FDLP ideals that have taken on mythological proportions. A framework for the future of the FDLP can be built if depository librarians take advantage of the new communication technology. Depository librarians can use this technology to develop partnerships and networks of depository libraries, government agencies, commercial publishers, organizations of information professionals, and citizens. In turn, depository librarians could form the virtual associations needed to develop new dissemination programs; create user interface software; consolidate lobbying efforts to develop a nationwide electronic information policy; and provide community information networks with national links. Finally, communications technology could enable depository librarians to form a consortium of depository libraries to manage a government information dissemination library program.

DT Article
AB This paper investigates the policy environment that will be needed to achieve the Dutch government's goal of acquiring a leading position in Europe in the development of the electronic superhighways. The paper summarizes the results of a study commissioned by the Rathenau Institute, which provides discussion papers for the Dutch parliament. The key findings are that companies in the telecommunications, broadcasting, computing and software, and information-producing sectors are competing for three types of control. These relate to access to networks, access to the customer and access to market information. The Dutch government needs to give more attention to policy and regulatory initiatives to address these developments. For example, the Dutch government could take the lead in Europe by establishing an integrated regulatory institution that deals with information 'carriage' and 'content' issues.

AB The question of the existence of limit cycles for scheduling policies used in a decentralized manner in manufacturing systems is one that has raised great interest in the literature, but all the studies consider one machine taken in isolation receiving all its inputs (or demands) from the external environment. This last characteristic implicitly assumed that there are no self loops, i.e., no task could receive inputs that were the output of a task in the same machine. In this work, besides showing the existence of limit cycles, for a class of policies considering one machine in isolation, with or without self loops, we make use of these results to present it new stabilization technique for multi-machine systems. The differences between this stabilization method and the previous results is also discussed.

ID NETWORK
AB Interest in information infrastructures has intensified as a result of the U.S. Federal government's National Research and Development (NREN) initiative. Our knowledge and experience with infrastructures such as roads and water supply is extensive. But our understanding of information infrastructure is in its infancy. This study defines an information infrastructure as a set of negotiated technical and social agreements of a certain reach and range using private or individual resources for the public or common purpose of enabling information flow across a series of jurisdictions or processes using a variety of digitally networked media.
   This paper draws from the information management literature, and research by a Syracuse University study team interested in the NREN development. The work provides a review of the literature and codification of what is known about information infrastructure development. Specifically the paper identifies what we know about information infrastructure's characteristics, benefits, costs, and governance. This study suggests there is much to learn. A great deal is known about aspects of information infrastructure building and it is presented in this work.  But research is needed to link these facets together into a deeper understanding of the life cycle of information infrastructures and their impact on individuals, organizations, and societies. Some next steps are outlined in directions for future research.

AB Analytical tools are required in modelling the transportation system and, in turn, the whole urban system. In this paper a model is presented which is useful in the evaluation of parking policies, which play an important role in transportation system management. The model consists of a supply model, a demand model and a supply/demand interaction model. The supply representation is network-based and proper functions are introduced in order to simulate the attributes related to parking choices. In particular, a behavioural approach is presented to simulate the searching time for an available parking space. The demand side of the model consist of a stochastic choice model applied to the path and parking levels of choice within a dynamic approach. Thus, the other levels of mobility choices are descriptively treated, giving rise to O/D matrices characterised by purpose of trip and desired duration of parking. In this implementation the O/D matrices are considered fixed and exogenously given. The removal of this hypothesis does not present theoretical problems. A multi-user equilibrium problem is solved and its theoretical properties are investigated. An application of the model is presented in order to show the capabilities of the model applied to a real network.

ID MODEL
AB Impact studies of future climate change on crop production have been hampered by the many uncertainties involved. Belief networks have been proved to be a very useful tool in dealing with uncertainties. However, the construction of a belief network for a complex application domain can be very difficult. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to exploit knowledge from existing mathematical models and hence ease the problem of belief network construction. A system was designed to show how the uncertainty of future climate change, variability of current weather, knowledge of human experts, and knowledge contained in crop simulation models can be integrated in a belief network, and to provide an aid for policy makers in agriculture. The constructed system was applied to simulate current and future potato growth in Kinless, Scotland, using synthetic weather data. Predictions given by our system agreed with those obtained from a conventional Monte Carlo simulation, and the system produced its predictions in a more flexible and efficient manner.

AB Intelligent monitoring facilities are of paramount importance in both service and network management as they provide the capability to monitor quality of service and utilisation parameters and notify degradations so that corrective action can be taken. By intelligent, we refer to the capability of performing the monitoring tasks in a way that has the smallest possible impact on the managed network, facilitates the observation and summarisation of information according to a number of criteria and, in its most advanced form, permits the specification of these criteria dynamically to suit the particular policy in hand. The OSI management metric monitoring and summarisation management functions provide models that only partially satisfy the above requirements. This paper describes our extensions to the proposed models to support further capabilities, with the intention to eventually lead to fully dynamically defined monitoring policies. The concept of distributing intelligence is also discussed, including the consideration of security issues and the applicability of the model in CORBA-based environments.

TI DEREGULATION, COMPETITION, AND THE NETWORK SIZE IN THE MARKET FOR
   TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES
SO JOURNAL OF REGULATORY ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes the networking aspect in telecommunication services and the recent divestiture and increased competitiveness of the industry. The product considered is the right to access the network. The utility of a consumer from having access to a network depends on the network's quality, defined by the number of other local and long-distance consumers which can be reached. Network services are provided in two layers; On the lower layer consumers within a local access and transport area (LATA) are connected to a central office which provides the basic switching facility for local telecommunication. On the upper layer, LATAs are connected together by an interLATA carrier, to enable long distance communication from different localities.
   It is shown that relative to the choices of an unconstrained monopolist, larger networks at both layers may be obtained by imposing quality controls, while price controls may have the opposite effect. A divestiture policy in which all local carriers are connected to a single long distance carrier is likely to reduce the quality of services at both layers. Introducing competition among long-distance carriers further reduces the quality of long distances services but may improve the local service.

ID POLICY RESPONSE
AB During the past 20 years a network of services, including official state agencies and statewide grassroots domestic violence coalitions, has developed across the country to meet the problem of woman abuse.  Although state agencies have gained access to diverse federal funds; have developed additional, more-creative ways to fund programs; and have established regulatory mechanisms to ensure quality of services, respondents agree that the existing services would not have been developed without the committed energy and effective lobbying of grassroots coalitions.  However, these coalitions are now struggling with internal conflicts and are concerned that emerging social problems will eclipse them and capture the scant funds available.  Without these coalitions, the network of social services may return the problem of woman abuse to the private arena of family life, where it is treated by therapy.  This article surveys both state agencies and coalitions and discusses implications for services to abused women.

TI Effect of government policies and vehicle marketing strategies on

LA English
DT Article
DE vehicle ownership; fuel consumption; logit model; government policy
ID EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; OWNERSHIP; CHOICE; MODEL
AB The objective of this paper is to develop demand models to forecast household vehicle demand and corresponding fuel consumption in Jordan. Understanding the factors that influence household vehicle quantity holdings provides a useful tool for developing strategies aimed at curtailing the contribution of automobiles towards environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and traffic accidents in urban areas. The demand for automobile and fuel by a household is simultaneously estimated by a joint discrete and continuous choice model. A multinomial logit model is used to examine the number of vehicles owned by a household, whereas a multiple regression model is used to predict the amount of fuel consumed. A random sample of households from the Greater Amman area is used to estimate demand and choice models. Results suggest that the socioeconomic characteristics of a household, government policies relating to vehicle import duties and vintage, and private sector marketing strategies, all influence a household's decision on the number of vehicles owned. Results strongly show that households with different vehicle ownership levels respond differently to government policies and car dealers' marketing strategies. Policy makers and transportation planners can use the results of this study to forecast the expected demand for used cars, and the increase in the number of new cars, given a set of government and private sector strategies. The results also can be used to predict fuel demand at various levels of household vehicle ownership. Transportation planners can also use these results to assist in formulating strategies regarding urban road network improvements, and future demand for public transportation.

TI MOTIVATION FOR EXCELLENCE IN FORESTRY RESEARCH
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Forestry cannot be considered as a single commodity and research is not a homogenous activity.  Forestry and its research are carried out in various topics, stages and types, locations, institutions, ecological zones, and stage of country development.  Excellence in research can apply to individual scientists, specialist groups, whole institutions, networks of institutions, and the managers of any of these.
   There is thus a multi-dimensional matrix within which to identify appropriate motivations for excellence.  Research excellence itself may have different implications for scientist, science managers, and financiers and policy-makers.  Motivating forces (incentives) are also varied but can be summarized simplistically as fame and fortune.  However, other factors may be equally important to individuals (security, career structure, personnel policies, creative freedom, relevance of research not just fashionableness, resources, managerial methods and general working environment).
   The structure and composition of the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO) is described and a summary of Canadian activities in IUFRO is included.

TI A SCIENTIFICALLY BASED NATIONWIDE ASSESSMENT OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY IN
   THE UNITED-STATES
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY AND WATER SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Beginning in 1986, the U.S. Geological Survey began an effort to develop a National Water-Quality Assessment Program.  The basic premise underlying this initiative is that a better understanding of the quality of water resources across the country, both surface- and groundwater, is needed to develop effective programs and policies to meet the nation's water-quality concerns.  The program will focus on water-quality conditions that are prevalent or large in scale, such as occur from nonpoint sources of pollution or from a high density of point sources.
   The design of the program is substantially different from the traditional approach of a diffuse national monitoring network.  The major activities of the assessment program will be clustered within a set of hydrologic systems (river basins and aquifer systems), referred to as study units.  In aggregate, the study units will account for a large part of the nation's water use and represent a wide range of settings across the country.
   Unique attributes of the program include:  (1) the use of consistent study approaches, field and laboratory methods, water-quality measurements, and ancillary data measurements for all study units; (2) the development of a progressive understanding of water-quality conditions and trends in each study unit through long-term studies that rotate periods of intensive data collection and analysis with periods during which the assessment activities are less intensive; and (3) the focus of considerable effort on synthesizing results from among the study units to provide information on regional and national water-quality issues.

AB The changing competitive hospital environment and recent greater availability of patient origin data have stimulated an increased research interest in factors influencing the reason patients are admitted to one hospital over another.  Hospital marketers and managed care planners seek information for attracting patients and for negotiating hospital provider networks, respectively.  Hospital choice models can help regulators make better informed assessments of the welfare implications of proposed mergers or closures.  The literature shows the development of increasingly sophisticated models and techniques for analysis of hospital choice.  Recent studies have also related the findings to health policy issues.  This review summarizes the historical developments and the cumulative knowledge gained about hospital choice to date, identifies some key issues in need of greater attention, and assesses the potential strengths and limitations of contemporary choice models for making policy impact assessments.

   TECHNOPOLITAN STRATEGIES
AB In order to retain their usefulness' and sense, technology and innovation policies have to evolve and keep pace with the socio-economic progress and changes taking place in their territories. An insight into these recent trends reveals that regional public actors are becoming increasingly concerned by the diffusion of innovative capability and technological know-how across their territories. The emergence of science parks and technopoles, mechanisms for strengthening university-industry ties, and the promotion of entrepreneurship as a way to increase the numbers of innovative start-up companies, are becoming widespread trends across European regions. The main concepts introduced in this paper, the 'technopolitan' system and strategies, arise from the recognition of such tendencies and inclinations in the innovation-related arena, at the regional level. Discussion of their content, nature and prospects constitutes the core of the study.

TI The problem of attention management in innovation for sustainability
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The problem of attention management is described as a major challenge in the transition to environmentally sustainable development paths. The design principle that attention is scarce is very different from a principle of ''more information is better'' when discussing problems of sustainability in technological development. The issue of ''attention management'' is discussed in various contexts, including R&D and innovation management, scientific communities, and technology policy. Given that environmental policies often ''grandfather'' existing technologies, more systemic environmental and technological strategies are called for. These require new models for integration of information from much wider ranges of sources and networks of expertise than is the case for present technological innovations in individual industries and companies.

TI The socio-economic benefits of a universal telephone network - A
   demand-side view of universal service
SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID UK
AB Universal service has become a major focus of debate within the telecommunications policy community. However, it has been narrowly focused on how universal service might be sustained and developed in the new competitive environment. As such, it has been supply-led, mainly concerned with financial transfers between suppliers to support the costs of providing service to customers or areas deemed 'uneconomic' and the impacts of new technologies upon those transfers. We take a different approach, posing the broader question: what are the social and economic benefits of a truly universal telephone service? We then use this demand-side perspective to readdress the universal policy agenda.

LA English
DT Article
AB The South Yorkshire Supertram project was devised by South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive to implement the policy of the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority. The civil engineering and managerial challenges of the project stem from the intention to use light rail technology to enhance the effective people-carrying capacity of the north-south road access to Sheffield city centre, the hilly and intensively built-up terrain, and the use of British Rail alignment on the north-eastern extension of the network. All these challenges have had to be addressed in the context of Government policy that excludes operating subsidy and seeks to obtain a substantial contribution to the cost of the project from surpluses of revenue over operating cost.

DT Article
AB Information and communication economics is a recent but rapidly evolving field of scientific research exploring a broad spectrum of policy and research issues. Research undertaken by the authors in the framework of the European Science Foundation (ESF-)-Network on European Communication and Transport Activities Research (NECTAR) makes a modest attempt to identify and analyse the structure of knowledge-based communication networks among individuals in academia. Universities have been chosen as a focus of research for to two reasons.
   In this paper emphasis is laid on individual contact and telecommunication networks and on determinants influencing the size, structure and spatial orientation of such networks. Empirical results are presented using data obtained from face-to-face interviews carried out in the period November 1989 to February 1990 at the University of Vienna, the Technical University of Vienna and the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration. The results clearly indicate the importance of the age and professional status of the university scholars. Cross-national comparisons illustrate that Vienna plays an important role as a centre for the transfer of knowledge for Eastern Europe.

AB Over the past several years, thousands of networked information resources have become available to individuals and institutions with access to the Internet. Unfortunately, the dizzying array of computing and networking environments often frustrates end users' attempts to navigate the Internet. Librarians have begun to take responsibility not only for instructing users in the use of basic network tools such as file transfer, remote log-in, and electronic mail, but also for answering questions concerning network access and even information system design. The authors show how, by continuing to adapt to this new and volatile environment, health sciences librarians find themselves playing increasingly important roles in shaping the information policies and practices of their institutions. To illustrate these new roles, the authors review the experiences of health sciences librarians at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, San Diego. These institutions have varying and complex networking environments, and their biomedical libraries have taken lead roles in clarifying and interpreting their particular Internet features.

AB Networked simulation for education and training is discussed as a functional capability though which Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) may find application in the non-Defense world. Effectiveness of networked simulation in Defense education and training applications has yet to be conclusively demonstrated, but studies completed thus far have yielded positive results. Results from non-Defense applications are also likely to be positive. The characteristics of networked simulation that are relevant to its transfer to non-Defense applications include a focus on group performance, physical dispersion of participants, requirements for real-time response, emergent task environments, visual task environments, accessible performance data, provisions for practice, immersive realism, and interactions with many entities. These characteristics are matched with potential, non-Defense applications of networked simulation such as training for crews, teams, and units, edutainment, education, training, school-to-work transitions, and lifelong learning. Remaining issues include further development of technical standards, legal standards, research and development, fiscal and regulatory policies, and development of the communications infrastructure.

AB The European Space Agency's studies of a Comet Nucleus Sample Return mission (ROSETTA) as its Planetary Cornerstone in its long-term programme 'Horizon 2000' and the Marsnet mission, a potential contribution of the Agency to an international network of surface stations on Mars, has revived the interest in the present state of Planetary Protection requirements. MARSNET was one of the four candidate missions selected in April 1991 for further Design Feasibility (Phase A) Studies. Furthermore, of all space agencies participating in planetary exploration activities only the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration had a well established Planetary Protection Policy on Viking and other relevant planetary missions, whereas ESA is considering the feasibility and potential impact of a planetary protection policy on its Marsnet mission, within the framework of a tight budgetary envelope applicable to ESA's Medium (M) class missions.
   This paper will discuss in general terms the impact of Planetary Protection measures, its implications for Marsnet and the issues arising from this for the implementation of the mission in ESA's scientific programme.

TI NETWORK FACILITIES IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT - A CONTRIBUTION FROM
   THE SPANISH DEBATE
SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB An observation of liberalized telecommunication services markets shows that competition has had limited impact so far.  The main cause of market distortions is the interdependence between operators; new entrants are obliged to use reserved facilities and services provided by incumbent operators, who are competitors in the same markets.  The neutral provision of these facilities and services could only be assured if the entrant had the option to install its own facilities.  This article makes the case for the provision of networks and facilities to be market led, ie entrants should be allowed to decide whether to use available facilities or install their own, depending on suitability, as with any other business investment.  The author introduces some considerations about the impact of this policy on universal service, existing networks, the introduction of new technologies and the role of agents.

AB Based on detailed interviews with major industry and trade organizations and an investigation of 46 electronics and professional equipment manufacturers, this paper finds that the environment in Hong Kong for technological innovation is relatively unconducive because the territory lacks specific policy objectives and appropriate support structures. The development of advanced technology is limited and is confined to large complex technology producers. The technology Linkage structure is fragmented and underdeveloped; technological interaction between local manufacturers, support organizations and tertiary institutions is lacking. Nevertheless, Hong Kong has the potential to develop an indigenous advanced technology base because of local entrepreneurship, technical ingenuity and an established international trading network. Policies to promote: technological innovation need to focus on fostering small and medium complex technology producers and local R & D linkages. The policy framework must be comprehensive and coherent; measures to improve the innovation environment alone are inadequate.

AB Environmental problems have become urgent in many countries. A large contribution to the solution of environmental problems is expected from technological change. This raises the issue of how technological change takes place, and more in particular how technological change can be promoted that is beneficial to long term sustainability objectives.
   In the paper we discuss this topic in the context of the transport sector, This is relevant because transportation contributes significantly to various types of pollution, existing trends might lead to even more negative impacts and finally there are high expectations about the potential of future technological development to reduce the environmental impact of transportation.
   We approach the issue of technological change towards more environmentally sound development from the perspective of technology dynamics and sustainable development. We argue that additional theoretical insights are needed especially when one wants to study technological change in the context of environmental problems. We therefore discuss a strategy of cooperation between government and firms in network. Special attention is paid to the role of the government in networks and the use of a new type of instruments.

AB CATV networks are often considered as a potential support for bringing multimedia applications to the home. One of the key problem induced is the sharing of a limited number of channels by the neighborhood population. This paper presents a capacity analysis of a CATV tree in a multimedia-on-demand environment for different channel allocation policies. A simulation model based on the user behavior is described. The effects and sensitivity to request queueing time are also shown. Results are compared to a zero waiting-time system on several key issues as the blocking probability and the total number of users supported by a single distribution tree.

AB The Health Sciences Libraries Consortium (HSLC) was established in 1985 by thirteen founding member institutions in Pennsylvania and Delaware. In 1989, the Interlibrary Loan, Document Delivery, and Union List Task Force, appointed by the HSLC Board of Directors, successfully demonstrated the feasibility of supplying 94% of all interlibrary loan (ILL) photocopy requests in forty-eight hours or less by a network application of group 3-level memory telefacsimiles. However, the expenses associated with the telefacsimile operation and the limitations associated with network polling protocols challenged participants to seek new alternatives for ILL. In 1990, the HSLC introduced HSLC HealthNET(TM), an online wide-area network linking eleven of the thirteen institutions and their resources while providing access to the Internet. The HSLC HealthNET additionally supports a centralized shared library system, several locally mounted databases, and consortiumwide electronic mail. In 1991, a project was initiated to evaluate Ariel(TM) software, pioneered by the Research Libraries Group (RLG), compared to the existing network application of group 3-level telefacsimiles. Factors identified as critical to Ariel's potential to replace the telefacsimile network were the proprietary software specifications for Internet access, the use of HSLC's existing wide-area network (WAN), and a hardware platform that was optimal for an ILL environment. This article describes the Ariel project history, the transition to Ariel from the telefacsimile network, evaluation of equipment features for processing efficiency, and operational issues affecting ILL policy.

AB A sampling network design model is presented that evaluates the trade-off between the varying costs of different types of data and the contribution of those data to improving model reliability. The methodology couples parameter-estimate and model-prediction uncertainty analyses with optimization to identify the mix of hydrogeologic information (e.g., head, concentration, and/or hydraulic conductivity measurement locations) that will minimize model prediction uncertainty for a given data collection budget. Two alternative optimization algorithms are presented and compared: a branch-and-bound algorithm and a genetic algorithm. A series of synthetic examples are presented to demonstrate the adaptability of the methodology to different sampling scenarios. The examples reveal two important properties of this network design problem. First, model-parameter and model-prediction uncertainty analyses are important components of the network design methodology because they provide a natural framework for evaluating the cost/information trade-off for different types of data and different sampling network designs. Second, the genetic algorithm can identify near-optimal solutions for a small fraction of the computational effort needed to determine the globally optimal solutions of the branch-and-bound algorithm.

TI ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION AND NETWORKING - SOME INDIAN EVIDENCE
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English
DT Article
ID PIONEERING-INNOVATIVE MANAGEMENT; ARCHETYPES
AB Research evidence indicates that entrepreneurs who exhibit a need for unique, path-breaking accomplishments (pioneering) and transforming the status quo (innovative) are quite different from other entrepreneurs. This is called the PI motive, which is found to be a constellation of policy commitments to pioneering novel outputs, technological sophistication and so on. The nature of these policy commitments underlines the need for and pattern of interpersonal networking behavior demonstrated by PI entrepreneurs. There is evidence to show that such networking is a means of raising required resources and thus plays an important role in the process of enterprise creation and growth. There are both active and latent networks, and those belonging to inner and outer circles.
   This paper discusses the findings of a study undertaken to see whether or not PI entrepreneurs showed greater networking behavior, and if so, to look al the nature of these networks and the purposes for which they were used Sixty-seven cases of small-scale entrepreneurs published in two Indian business journals constituted the data. In order to know the pioneering innovative orientation of entrepreneurs covered, independent professionals rated the cases on the presence or absence of ten types of innovations including the Schumpeterian innovations.
   It was found that entrepreneurs with high PI scores resorted to networking to raise critical resources more than those with low PI scores. High PI entrepreneurs did not merely adopt the suggestions or ideas acquired from their networks but synthesized them in a way that resulted in substantial learning. Networks, especially with inner circle contacts, provided hard resources such as capital and technology. Family and friends formed the major sources of resources.
   The search for excellence of PI entrepreneurs goes beyond their firms into the large communities with which they deal. For them the goals/visions of their business do not seem to be limited to considerations of survival or even money making; they would like to be change agents and bring about transformations in the industry and economy. Because of their emphasis on new products, markets, technology and so on, PI entrepreneurs showed behaviors that build capabilities to manage uncertainty and risk and build credibility to attract favorable attention and support. Towards this end, they tended to scan the environment constantly, collaborated with customers and consultants, and focused on enhancing professionalism in organizations Similarly, their goals to influence groups related to their business required them to provide leadership in addressing industry/community issues, and the development of a distinct identity. lt is shown that the business and non-business goals of PI entrepreneurs support each other-the higher networking behavior is a common denominator underlying both the personal and business agenda of the PI entrepreneur.

AB This paper uses the fundamental values of decision makers to guide a long-term wastewater planning process at Seattle Metro, a major utility district. Multiattribute value assessment is used to elicit the objectives of several elected officials and other key decision makers. The results are structured into a fundamental objectives hierarchy and a means-ends objectives network. A set of measures to indicate the performance of planning alternatives in terms of the fundamental objectives is developed. Preliminary value tradeoffs between objectives are elicited from several elected officials. The results of these steps are useful for many aspects of long-term planning: facilitating communication about values and priorities; designing attractive alternatives that are more likely to serve stakeholder interests; identifying information needed to evaluate alternatives; clarifying the relative importance of information about different impacts; providing a basis for quantitative evaluation of the alternatives with multiple objective analysis; and focusing attention on key tradeoffs that will affect the choice of alternatives.

DT Article
AB In a large scale distributed environment or large open networks like WIDE Internet which is an academic and research network in Japan, the authentication system is the fundamental building block for providing security mechanisms.  We have developed a trusted third-party authentication system called SPLICE/AS for the WIDE Internet.  The authentication protocol adopted in SPLICE/AS is based on the public-key encryptosystem, originally proposed by Needham.  We made several extensions to detct some sort of security attacks like replay attacks which were not considered in the original Needham's approach.  Furthermore, the domain-based management scheme and protocol extensions are introduced to our system since management principals are scattered across the WIDE Internet.  The whole network is logically subdivided into several domains based on network management policies, and each domain is managed by a single authentication server.  Then, the domain concept is applied in a hierarchical manner to provide the inter-domain access.  An authentication server existing in an upper domain authorizes and controls inter-domain accesses between subdomains.  This paper describes the design of SPLICE/AS, and its implementations.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to introduce the capacitated hub-and-spoke network design problem in which hubs have limited capacity for channelling flows between the nodes served by the system.  The problem is formulated under a networking policy allowing both direct (nonstop) and hub connected (one-hub-stop and two-hub-stop) services between the nodes.  A branch and bound algorithm and a heuristic procedure partitioning the set of solutions on the basis of hub locations are presented.  In both algorithms, after identifying a set of hub locations, the problem is reduced into a smaller routing problem.  Subgradient optimization is then applied to a Lagrangian relaxation of the reduced problem.  The model and the proposed algorithms were applied to the air transportation system using data on passenger flows between the top forty US cities in 1989 (accounting for 73.32% of the surveyed passenger flow).  Computational results from 141 problems suggest that both algorithms are effective at finding good solutions to this problem.

TI The Nutrient Flow Model for Dutch agriculture: A tool for environmental
   policy evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE nutrient flows; micro simulation; environmental policy evaluation
AB The Nutrient Flow Model (NFM) is a micro-simulation model. It describes economic activities and corresponding nutrient flows at farm level for present and future situations in which environmental policy measures are taken. The farm results are aggregated to regional and national levels. The model can be used as an instrument for monitoring and policy evaluation. Technical aspects are incorporated into the model by means of crop growth models and nutrient balances for animals. Economic aspects are partly incorporated and partly added exogenously. The information need for the NFM is rather extensive. Main data sources are the Dutch Agricultural Census and the Dutch Farm Account Data Network. The model tries to combine the detailed approach with respect to production activities and nutrient flows that is often found in models at farm level with the more global approach that is followed in economic models on sector level. The variation in emissions between farms is dealt with explicitly.
   This paper presents the general concept of the NFM. It shows that the validation of technical models used in the NFM, on the basis of empirical data, is essential from the point of view of nutrient losses. An example is given of the assessment of the effects of government policies: the obligatory injection of manure may lead to a decrease in ammonia volatilisation but, at the same time, to an increase in nitrate leaching.
   The integrated approach of dealing with different nutrients simultaneously, taking into account all inputs and outputs, describing the complete chain of nutrient flows within farms, and modelling the interaction between farms makes the NFM a suitable instrument for the evaluation of environmental policy.

TI IMPACTS OF REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS ON URBAN-DEVELOPMENT IN
   JAPAN
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Urban agglomerations in Tokyo and Osaka in post-war period are largely attributable to the policies underlying the four National Development Plans implemented in that period. These policies, which were originally intended to achieve an effect on the opposite of agglomeration, relate primarily to the high-speed transit network known as the Tokaido shinkasen and the expressway segments linking the Kanto and Kansai regions.
   For the purpose of capturing the historical scenario of regional agglomeration, we have formulated a long-term macro-econometric model from 1950-85, with 5-year simulation cycles. This constitutes an employment distribution block, an input-output block, and an interprefectural activities block, incorporating all major macro-variables.
   In an earlier stage of this research the model was calibrated and the total tests upon all formulations were completed. Ascertaining that the accuracy of the model is well within permissible limits, an evaluation of policy scenarios due to the delay in the introduction of the shinkansen on the Tokaido line, has been conducted. Results indicate that Tokyo grows much less rapidly than in reality, Osaka maintains the same rate of growth, and the other areas show a substantial growth by 1985.
   In the present version, we improve on the model with respect to its qualitative performance by relaxing the exogeneity of national employment and GNP to allow for the evaluation of these policy variables. In completing these final tests on the model, we are able to confirm the validity of the model by demonstrating its accuracy to be in a satisfactory range. In a case study, the policy areas that have contributed to the present distribution of development have been explored in detail. Comparative policy transformations, necessary to achieve the opposite effects to agglomeration, are discussed.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB This paper presents a multi-modal freight transportation model based on a digitized geographic network. A systematic analysis and decomposition of all the transport operations, i.e. moving, loading and unloading, transshipping and transiting, leads to the development of a virtual network where each virtual link corresponds to a specific operation, and all transportation modes and means are inter-linked. Software, called NODUS, automatically generates the virtual network so that the model can be conveniently applied to large networks. The analytical structure of the links notation makes it easy to attach specific cost functions to each virtual link. The model is applied to the trans-European freight network of roads, railways and inland waterways for the transportation of wood. Cost functions are built up for each operation by each mode/means combination. A detailed point-to-point origin-destination matrix, calibrated on Eurostat statistics, is generated by a Monte-Carlo technique. Then, the total transportation cost is minimized with respect to the choices of routes, modes and means. This provides estimations of transportation services demands as well as modal splits, to the extent that the two hypotheses of demand based on generalized cost minimization and market contestability are accepted. A sensitivity analysis on the relative road cost is made, which provides measures of are-elasticities. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

DT Article
AB An effective telecommunications infrastructure is of vital importance for the economical and social growth of a geographically isolated country such as Australia, The reform policy chosen by Australia introduces competition in the supply of network facilities for public network services by licensing a second end-to-end facility carrier under a duopoly arrangement, The Australian approach to the introduction of competition can be seen as a learning experience for other countries still dominated by national PTTs, Little is known in Europe about the Australian telecommunications environment and the effects of the recent telecommunications reforms on the telecommunications infrastructure in Australia, These factors combined to make the Australian telecommunications environment an interesting and dynamic subject for research.

AB This paper focuses on the practical aspects of the integration of security services into telecommunication management applications as well as the building blocks needed to achieve a company wide security policy and ensure the consistent usage throughout the Telecommunication Management. Network. The OSI security architecture [7] provides the flexibility necessary for the adaption to environments that deal with highly sensitive data like security management in a distributed telecommunication management network. However, to achieve interworking between implementations of different vendors it is of crucial importance to define functional security profiles and hence define an implementable subset of tire security services suited to TMN. Prototype implementation and testing in the RACE project R2058 SAMSON has demonstrated that the security services and architectures currently under standardisation are capable to provide sufficient security mechanisms.

LA English
DT Article
AB The Italian mountains, particularly the peninsular ones, are undergoing a period of change. Following social and economic crises that caused massive depopulation in the past thirty years, a new phase is beginning in which interest in the mountains has revived considerably.
   The rugged landscapes of the central Apennines harbor phenomena of significant ecological and cultural value. In addition, the centers of many historic towns dating back to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are perfectly preserved in their original ''castle'' forms.
   Recently, through national legislation, a large network of national parks has been established, motivated by the valuable wildlife habitats, the scenic rural landscapes, and the historic communities. It provides the last hope for re-establishing social vitality in these mountains.
   This study in Abruzzo, a region well-known for its ancient architectural sites, analyses the effect of the national parks on the social and economic conditions of the mountain population and the new functional roles that mountain centers may play. The results provide a point of reference for environmental protection policy and conservation measures in all Italian mountain ranges.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has received an explosion of interest during the last 5 years in various fields. There is no longer any question that expert systems and neural networks will be of central importance for developing the next generation of more intelligent geographic information systems. Such knowledge-based geographic information systems will play an especially key role in spatial decision and policy analysis related to issues such as environmental monitoring and management, land use planning, motor vehicle navigation, and distribution logistics. This paper sketches briefly the major characteristics of conventional geographic information systems, and then looks at some of the potentials of AI principles and techniques in a GIS environment where emphasis is laid on expert systems and artificial neural networks technologies and techniques.

AB In recent years, object database systems have emerged as a new technology, integrating object-oriented paradigms with transaction and query capabilities of conventional database systems.  The strength of distributed object database systems is further enhanced by new generations of powerful workstations.  The synergy between object databases and the networked workstation environment, however, brings forth a new set of challenges.  In this paper, we address the issues of managing object schemas in a cooperative network environment.  After reviewing existing solutions, we present a more dynamic approach to the problem of distributed schema management.  We also show how this approach can serve as a general framework for supporting various schema management policies.

The streams of literature drawn upon include second-order cybernetics and chaos theory, organizational sociology, and the literature on the state. The concept of the autopoietic state is developed as a basis for determining appropriate communication policy principles for maximizing the democratic potential in the network environment.

AB Multimedia synchronization is one of the key issues to be resolved in order to have smooth multimedia presentations. The demand of bringing multimedia information systems into distributed environments makes multimedia synchronization more difficult. In this paper, we apply extended finite state machines (EFSM) to formally specify multimedia synchronization among multiple media streams. Using the EFSM model, the intra-medium synchronization is handled by an actor, which is formally represented as an EFSM, The inter-media synchronization is handled by a synchronizer, which is also represented as an EFSM, Both centralized and distributed synchronization cases can be specified. Synchronizer and Actors achieve the corresponding multimedia presentations cooperatively. We also propose some policies to rectify the random delays caused by networks in the distributed presentation case. These policies, which can be formally specified in the corresponding EFSMs, are classified as intra-stream and inter-stream synchronization policies. Using the EFSM-based model, an authoring system and an associated experimental execution environment has been developed on SUN SPARC workstations.

TI Urban reactions to the global warming issue: Agenda setting in Toronto

SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB Little research has been done about what cities could or should do concerning potential global warming. A few cities have adopted programs to deal with impacts they perceive may occur, and a worldwide network of 100 cities involved with CO2 reduction has recently emerged. Global warming is a new issue for cities and most are only dimly aware of how it may affect them. Toronto, through the efforts of a few leaders, has become a pioneer in the development of an urban response program to global warming. It has charged a city agency to deal with global warming issues, in particular emissions reduction. Chicago is aware of the issue and is concerned about the negative impacts global warming could produce. While behind Toronto, Chicago is moving forward in a number of areas. These two cities illuminate the policy-making process for global warming at the urban level and the role 'policy entrepreneurs' can play at this level. In comparing the two cities, a common model of policy development is utilized.

AB A number of social, judiciary, and regulatory policies are intended to change current educational practices: educational change, however, does not automatically occur as a result of policy adoption. Rather, educational change occurs as a result of leaders employing systematic procedures to bring about these changes. A growing philosophical, legal, and empirical data base supports the inclusion of students with severe disabilities in general education settings. This paper presents guidelines intended for educational leaders in effecting the change from segregated to inclusive school settings. Five systematic phases, or guidelines, are presented. In order to bring about successful inclusion of students with severe disabilities, leaders develop networks, assess resources, review options, install inclusion strategies, and provide a system of feedback and self-renewal.

ID RECOURSE; MODEL
AB In this paper, we model production problems where yields are stochastic, demands are substitutable, and several items are jointly produced. We formulate this problem as a profit maximizing convex program, and study two approximation procedures. The first method solves finite horizon stochastic programs on a rolling horizon basis. We develop a decomposition algorithm for solving the finite horizon problems. The finite horizon problems are linear programs. Our algorithm utilizes the network-like structure of the coefficient matrix of the linear programs. The second method is a heuristic procedure that is based on the structure of the optimal policy for two-period problems. The heuristic parallels the decision rules used by managers in practice. The computational results suggest that the performance of this heuristic is comparable to that of the rolling horizon approach.

   ENVIRONMENT; FIBER OPTIC TRANSMISSION
AB Structured cabling is an important issue faced by most Information Technology departments today.  Cable plant is expected to have a 10 to 15 year lifetime and must withstand the pressures imposed by frequent office moves, and user demands for ever more sophisticated communications fuelled by a rapidly advancing technology.  Fibre optics can provide the performance requirements of the next generations of networks, but apart from a minority of specialist applications a widespread application of fibre to the desk has not been economically justified today.  However, the judicious selective use of fibre can provide the 'future proof' evolution required in a cost effective way.  This paper looks at the issue of fibre optic transmission for local area networks, the fibre optic basis every IT manager should know, what cabling systems should be installed and what are the fibre optic options.  Advice on fibre installation policy is also given.

TI RETHINKING DEVELOPMENT - A ROLE FOR INNOVATION NETWORKING IN THE OTHER

LA English
DT Article
AB As global competition intensified and the rate of technological innovation and diffusion accelerated over the 1970s and 1980s, the sustainability of comparative advantage based solely on the existence of location-specific raw materials or cheap labour began to erode and innovation emerged as the key to competitiveness. For those few Third World countries that successfully passed through the window of opportunity for effective catch-up strategies that opened in the 1970s, a base was laid for innovation in products, processes or organizational technologies. The 'other two-thirds', however, were singularly unprepared to meet the challenges of a changing technological and competitive environment.  In large part this resulted from the contradictions generated by the mass production, import reproduction model to which they had remained wedded for several decades. During the 1980s, a number of changes took place, in the strategies of multinational corporations with respect to the internationalization of R&D and the role of overseas subsidiaries more generally, and in government policies with respect to the role of innovation in international competitiveness. A slow process of technological accumulation in both public and private sector enterprises and universities in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean also got underway. These changes provide the foundation upon which well crafted policies to promote networks for innovation can be developed.  In Latin America a number of such networks are already in place, and the article discusses the new role that both states and international donors are playing in stimulating and supporting them. A brief look at how such approaches might be adapted and generalized to Africa is also offered.

AB This study describes an aspect of school-based management that previously has been ignored.  Drawing on concepts from an institutional theory of organizations, this study describes the actors who shaped and promoted school-based management in the national arena, their interests, and the network that linked them.  Three categories of actors are identified:  policy actors, teachers union actors, and academic actors.  The most prominent actors were often organizations rather than individuals.  The actors shared two overarching goals:  to improve the effectiveness of public schools and enhance the professional status of teachers.  The actors were linked by an informal network; that is, they were loosely organized.  These and other findings suggest that school-based management was at least partially the product of the institutional environment in which schools and school districts operated.

AB Routing decisions play an important role in managing the operations of LTL motor carriers. They strongly interact with service and terminal operation policy choices and are particularly sensitive to variations in demand. We conducted several studies with large Canadian carriers, using a network optimization based methodology for tactical planning of freight transportation that we developed. We obtained results that illustrate the complexity of the routing decisions and the importance of tactical analysis and planning for the efficiency of intercity freight transportation.

AB The paper describes a knowledge-based online consultant which assists system operators with the simulation and control of railway systems which can assist the planning engineer by providing an accurate, easy-to-use, and flexible environment for studying different aspects of proposed expansion plans according to various requirements. It can also be used for training young engineers on the familiarisation of operating policy. Using the package, any change in the supply network and any deviation in train services from those given in the basic system configuration are assessed, and the corresponding effects on the system as a whole are simulated from time to time. Proposed changes in the operating strategy can then be verified and carried out in confidence.

LA English
DT Article
AB Much effort has gone into studying navigation algorithms for mobile-robot systems. However, although mobile-robot systems often suffer from a lack of adequate on-board memory and communication bandwidth, little work has been done on techniques to solve these problems. Two algorithm-implementation strategies are examined to solve the memory-limitation and communication-bandwidth-limitation problems associated with the navigation of single or multiple robots in large dynamic environments. On-board main-memory-management mechanisms, cache policies, auxiliary-memory data structures, and two path planners are explored by simulations based on a new navigation algorithm. One- and two-level caches with one- and two-level planning, respectively, are investigated; these can easily be extended to schemes with more levels. Our results show that among the seven (three local and four global) cache policies studied, the predicted-window, aisle, and via-point policies overcame the above limitations without compromising robot performance. Therefore, one or more of these three policies can be used with implementation strategies to deal with the memory-limitation and communication-bandwidth-limitation problems encountered in real-world mobile-robot navigation. Our results can also be very useful in the domain of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS), where the main memory of the on-board computer may be too small to hold all of the road network and other useful information.

TI Epoch-making decision in internetworking: NTT's open network declaration
   from a historical perspective
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Heated debate still continues in Japan as to whether or not the world largest common carrier Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, NTT, be divested.(1) As NTT's declaration of network opening (hereafter Open Network Declaration, or OND) was made public in the midst of this controversy, it was sometimes mistaken as a counterproposal to escape from breaking up. However, its significance will become apparent when we trace the history of interconnection as well as competition in Japan. This article tries to identify several precedents of network opening, and to place OND appropriately in the public policy under competitive environment [1]. The first section analyzes the performance of the telecommunications market and points out how barriers to competition have been eliminated or kept intact since its liberalization in 1985. The second section observes liberalization from a longer-term perspective, beginning in the early '70s, and describes how computer communication developed. The third section surveys how OND may change the business environment. The final section draws attention to the future, when many subnetworks are interlinked through OND, and emphasizes the importance of a dispute-settling mechanism for interconnection.

TI PRODUCTION PLANNING-MODELS FOR A CENTRAL FACTORY WITH MULTIPLE SATELLITE
   FACTORIES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The production planning problem of minimizing total cost, which consists of transportation cost, processing cost, raw material holding cost, and finished product inventory holding cost in a network of factories involving a central factory and multiple satellite factories is investigated in this paper. Based on two different raw material purchase plans, two non-linear mathematical programming models are formulated. In the first model, the material ordering policy at any given factory is based on the aggregation of each raw material type demanded over all items to be manufacured in the factory during a given production period. In the second model, lot consolidation for ordering is not done. The raw materials for each item produced by a factory are ordered separately. These two models integrate the raw material supply factory selection problem, order size determination, order processing sequence, and material handling functions to define a cost-effective production plan. The results from the model define a production plan, material purchase policy between factories, and selection of factory site (producing or purchasing factory) to hold items in inventory in order to minimize total factory network cost. Heuristics, which used two linear mixed-integer programming submodels, are developed to solve the models. An example problem and deveral test results are given to demonstrate the use of the developed models and algorithms.

TI Congestion control in asynchronous, high-speed wormhole routing networks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB High-speed networks use lightweight protocols and a simple switch architecture for achieving higher speeds. A lightweight switching technique for local area and campus environments is wormhole routing, in which the head of a packet (worm), upon arriving at an intermediate switch, is immediately forwarded to the next switch on the path. Thus, the packet, like a worm, may stretch across several intermediate switches and links. Wormhole routing networks provide low latency. However, they are particularly prone to congestion, thus requiring careful flow control. In this article, the authors consider high-speed, asynchronous, unslotted wormhole routing networks. For such networks, two different flow control mechanisms are compared and contrasted, namely, backpressure flow control and deflection routing (with local input rate control). With backpressure, in order to maintain deadlock-free routing, either up/down routing or shortest path routing with virtual channels is assumed. With deflection routing, to avoid livelocks, worm alignment (delayed deflection) is performed at switches. It is shown via simulation that the throughput performance of the two schemes is comparable (except for up/down routing). The authors also discuss the tradeoffs with respect to complexity of hardware, routing protocols and buffer requirements. The authors further examine the role of input rate control at the hosts to overcome unbounded delays typical of deflection routing, and show it is possible to achieve lower average number of hops and transit delays by employing suitable input rate central policies.

AB In the last few years, groundwater management has concentrated on the protection of groundwater quality.  An increasing number of countries has adopted policies to protect vital groundwater resources from deterioration by regulating human interaction with the subsurface, the use of potential contaminants, land use restrictions, and waste transport and storage.
   One of the more common regulatory approaches to the protection of groundwater focuses on public water supplies to reduce the potential of human exposure to hazardous contaminants.  Under the framework of the Safe Drinking Water Act amended by U.S.  Congress in 1986, The U.S. EPA (1987) issued guidelines for the delineation of wellhead protection areas, recommending the use of analytical and numerical models for the identification of such areas.
   In this study, the theoretical background for the development of one such numerical model is presented.  Two real-world applications are discussed:  in the first case history, the model is applied to a Superfund Site in Puerto Rico as a tool for assessment of the effectiveness of a proposed pump-and-treat scheme for aquifer remediation.  Based on simulation results for the evolution of the existing contaminant plume it was verified that such a scheme would not work with the proposed purging wells.  The second case history is the delineation of a wellhead protection area in the Town of Littleton, Massachusetts, and subsequent design of a monitoring well network.

AB Twenty years after Lee's ''Requiem for Large-Scale Models'', the urban modeling held is again full of life. There exist a dozen or so operational urban models of varying degrees of comprehensiveness and sophistication, which have been and are being applied to real-life metropolitan regions for purposes of research and/or policy analysis. The paper views the current state of the art of operational ''integrated'' urban models. It starts by presenting the map of active centers of urban modeling research in the world. Next it defines a framework for the classification and evaluation of urban models, using as criteria comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality, and actual and potential applications. The paper closes by speculating about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB This paper provides an overview of the situation of public transit in the Federal Republic of Germany as well as its integration into considerations of transportation policy.  It is the goal of transportation policy to effect a shift of parts of urban automobile traffic to public transit.  Beyond restrictions on private vehicle travel this requires an improvement of the service quality of public transit.  Research and development in public transit serve this goal.  The emphasis of research is in the following areas:  organization of public transit, expansion of fixed-guideway transit systems in major cities, use of demand-responsive operation modes with low travel demand, improvement of transit network and schedule structure, acceleration and stabilization of transit vehicle progression, improvement of comfort levels for access and transport, differentiation of fares and simplification of fare structure, improvement of passenger information and assistance and rationalization of service provision.

ID URBAN
AB The relationship between transport infrastructure and regional development is not monocausal. In addition to the causal link between infrastructure and regional development there is also a reverse link from regional development to infrastructure investments. In the present paper we investigate the latter relationship at the interregional level. A number of factors having an impact on infrastructure supply is formulated including regional and interregional demand, construction costs, financing possibilities, regional policies and border effects. An empirical study is carried out for the supply of railways and highways in a set of regions in the EU. It is found that most of these factors indeed have a significant impact on infrastructure supply. No significant result could be found, however, for regional policies. Also, at a broad spatial level, no indications are found that border regions are suffering from a lack of infrastructure supply.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Much of the past research on file migration and file replication has examined these two resources management strategies in isolation or in an environment where they do not work together. We establish through simulation that these two strategies can be utilized simultaneously to potentially provide significant performance benefits over a system without file migration or replication. File replication can be viewed as a natural extension to file migration, and thus, we derive a dynamic file replication policy based on an established file migration heuristic a file is migrated (or replicated) whenever a reduction in total mean response time of the file requests currently in the affected storage sites can be achieved. Through our performance model, we use simulation to establish the conditions under which our file migration/replication policies are beneficial in a distributed file system.

   OF INNOVATION
AB The new industrial policy approach of the European Community (EC) stresses that industrial adjustment has to be supported by the creation of a positive environment for inter-firm cooperation, the promotion of conditions for entrepreneurship and innovation, the full development of innovative opportunities, and the development of human capabilities (article 130 of the Treaty of Maastricht). Since the national systems of innovation are still very different throughout Europe, the EC decided in the late 1980s to reverse the convergence process from top-down to bottom-up, by introducing programmes which attempt to stimulate the creation of networks of innovators. This approach was clearly influenced by the debate on industrial districts and by the more general debate on innovation diffusion. It is based on the possibility of favouring aggregations of firms, research institutes, universities, framed in their own national contexts, but forced to cooperate in producing innovation.

AB Using data collected from mental health services delivery systems in 4 cities, this study examines the relationship between resource acquisition, resource utilization, and 3 types of cooperative, client-based interorganizational relationships: referrals received, referrals sent, and case coordination. Relationships were first explored for all 138 agencies in all 4 systems and then under conditions of environmental resource scarcity versus munificence, as measured by per capita mental health spending by the state. Results generally supported the 3 hypotheses proposed but were strongest for case coordination and for systems embedded in resource-scarce environments. Implications of the results for policy and research are discussed as they pertain to building a better understanding of conditions conducive to cooperation among health and human service agencies that provide community-based services to the severely mentally ill and other client groups with long-term needs.

TI PERFORMANCE ISSUES IN OBJECT REPLICATION FOR A REMOTE CACHING

DE PERFORMANCE; OBJECT REPLICATION; REMOTE CACHING ARCHITECTURE
AB The high performance networks in modern distributed systems enable a site to obtain cached objects from the main memory of other sites more quickly than the time needed to access local disks. In this environment, efficient mechanisms can be devised to support rapid request/response exchanges for objects that reside on remote sites. As a result, it becomes possible to use remote memory as an additional layer in the memory hierarchy between local memory and disks.
   This paper studies the effect of policies on cache performance in a remote caching architecture. A key issue is managing the number of object replicas maintained by different sites. Although exploiting remote memory improves performance over a wide range of cache sizes as compared to a distributed client/server caching architecture, efficient use of remote memory can be difficult to achieve. We develop an analytical model of system performance in a remote caching architecture, and identify critical system parameters affecting this performance. Performance evaluation can guide system designers in selecting the appropriate cache replacement and cache management policies for this environment. Several policies are examined, and their effect on both overall and local system performance is described.

ID ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION
AB Ledermann introduced a model that has been the subject of delegate, empirical investigations and conceptual refinement. He proposed that a unimodal skewed curve typifies the distribution of consumption in a population, and that there is a positive relationship between the mean of consumption and the proportion of heavy consumers. His work, while considered to be inaccurate on specific estimates and details, nevertheless sets the stage for further explorations into the relationships between overall consumption and heavy consumption, and provides a basis for understanding how changes in access to alcohol have a bearing on overall rates of alcohol consumption as well as prevalence of heavy use. Explanations of these relationships have focused on social networks and ''contagion'' hypotheses.
   While these topics have been of considerable interest in the scientific community, lay people, particularly policy makers, have largely been excluded from the discussion because the theory has not been introduced to them in practical terms. For instance, many people do not understand term such as ''absolute alcohol,'' ''standard drink,'' ''range of consumers,'' ''log normal distribution,'' ''incidence levels,'' and ''contagion.'' Therefore, citizens elected to formulate policy are not aware of the relationships between drinking environment and problems, and the role of policy in moderating or contributing to drinking levels.
   In order to influence the development of enlightened public policy, a key challenge for the scientific community is to utilize educational techniques that would transform academic thinking into lay understanding, presenting the ideas in everyday language, and wa examples and concepts that are in tune with experiences of the drinker and the citizen. This will require the use of imagery, visual props, graphics, and drinking stories which are communicated through a mix of personal conversations, group presentations and mass media in order to foster convergence of the products of research and the needs of policy makers.

TI Operability analysis of marine projects based on Markov theory
SO APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The operability of marine operations, that is, the estimation of their weather downtime and duration, is traditionally determined either by means of risk analysis or Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The work presented herein establishes analytically the probability distribution and statistical parameters of the duration of individual activities of a marine project based on the theory of Markov chains. According to the proposed Markov model the distribution of the duration of an activity is associated with certain statistical properties of the return time, that is the period between two successive passages from the non-operable state. Information about individual activities is then combined according to the PNET methodology, as proposed by Ang, A. H. S., Abdelnour, J. & Chaker, A. A., Analysis of activity networks under uncertainty. J. Engng Mech. Div., ASCE, 101 (EM4) (1975) 373-387 which considers the sequence of the execution of the activities, as defined by the operations scenario of the project, in order to establish analytically the probability distribution of the duration of the project.
   The statistical analysis distinguishes between activities which do not require a weather window for their execution and those which do. Policies which affect the execution of an activity are incorporated into the analysis by taking into consideration secondary tasks which are performed before or after its temporary suspension. Furthermore, performance efficiency factors are also introduced in order to reflect the influence of the prevailing sea state/vessel responses on the ability of the crew to carry out the activity.
   The Markov model is applied for a range of uninterrupted durations to activities which do or do not require a weather window and the results are compared with those from a Monte Carlo simulation. Good agreement is obtained for the mean durations but significant deviation is evident for the second order moments. This behaviour is attributed to the length of the record and also to the distribution of the return times. Agreement between the results of the two models is generally better for activities of low uninterrupted duration which do not require a weather window.
   Finally, the combined Markov/PNET methodology is illustrated with an example for a hypothetical project and results are compared with those from a Monte Carlo simulation. Similar conclusions to those mentioned above are drawn. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB Decentralized construction of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is substituting market-driven, 'de facto' standards and voluntary agreements on standards for technical compatibility, in place of the engineering decisions once made by public (and quasi-public) telecommunications network operators. Due to strategic economic behaviours on the part of private businesses and national governments, the goal of a fully interoperable GII remains elusive. The Internet does not offer an entirely credible alternative model, as the standards that have facilitated its explosive growth also are contributing to serious congestion problems, and the solutions proposed point to the Internet's re-integration into the public switched telecommunications network. Technical standards will shape the GII's implications for international trade and competition, and thus raise important, but inadequately recognized issues for regulation, competition and trade policy.

DE COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; OPEN DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS; COOPERATIVE
   APPLICATIONS
AB We describe the need for the collaboration of managers in cooperative applications where the federative application context must be harmonized with the hierarchical component environment.  A cooperative management concept is introduced which augments existing hierarchical management policies and procedures.  The concept includes proposals for federations, 'manager' domains and collaboration procedures.  It relates a group of managers to a group of managed objects, and proposes rules for collaboration between the managers before executing operations on the objects.  Some possible application areas, including inter-domain information management, customer network management, the management of virtual private networks (VPN) and trading in open distributed processing (ODP), are discussed.  A related approach is described for comparison.  Remarks on the importance of adequate access control mechanisms and on the need for the dynamic creation and modification of manager groups are added.

AB This paper provides an analytical framework for understanding the intersection of cyberspace (i.e., an environment in which interactive electronic information networking is possible) and outer space. By utilizing this framework we can better understand the anatomy of the growing problem of 'crimes' in the field of satellite communications. The framework can facilitate answers to such questions as to whether and when an instance occurred, what jurisdiction is likely to be involved; and what parties were involved. The paper is intended to raise a number of legal and policy issues, where information networking and space communication intersect. The paper concludes that as cyberspace and outer space become increasingly internationalized there will probably be a need for more law created to govern and enforce satellite operation and regulate abuses related to their use.

TI RAILWAY PRIVATIZATION - DOES IT BRING NEW OPPORTUNITIES
SO PUBLIC MONEY & MANAGEMENT

DT Article
AB A recent White Paper outlined proposals for privatizing British Rail's assets and activities. This article reviews the aims of the proposed measures, and examines what effect they could have on passenger services, freight services and investment. It concludes that the Government's objectives, such as service quality and maintenance of the network, are unlikely to be met. Rail service provision and traffic could decline, despite the main aim of increasing rail's share of transport. This contrasts with the strategy that most other countries in Europe are taking, with the aim of exploiting more effectively rail's contribution to the economy and the environment. Reg Harman concludes by outlining the package of policy measures which could underpin a similar approach for Britain's railway system.

AB Since the Conservatives came to government in 1979 the policy climate generally in the U.K. has been one of the privatization of public provision and tighter controls on public spending. A re-positioning of health and social care has taken place in the light of this pre-eminence of market forces with the assumption increasingly being made that potential service users operate on a 'level playing field' of opportunity. A major consequence has been the expansion of household health responsibilities through measures which include a greater emphasis on preventative screening and healthy lifestyles and a general shift in the locus of care to the 'community'. Not only has the last decade seen this intensification of pressure on women in their social role as family carers, a restructuring has taken place of the U.K. labour market such that the 'double burden' of paid and unpaid work is an increasingly common experience. Contrary to the policy view of equality of access, in-depth interview evidence from Liverpool shows that the health care behaviour of many women is increasingly constrained by their social roles and availability of economic and social network resources. This paper distinguishes between groups who are and are not well equipped to cope in the light of changing structures of provision and discusses the implications of the research for the design and implementation of health and social care.

ID SERVICE; SYSTEM
AB In a video-on-demand environment, continuous delivery of video streams to the clients is guaranteed by sufficient reserved network and server resources. This leads to a hard limit on the number of streams that a video server can deliver. Multiple client requests for the same video can be served with a single disk I/O stream by sending (multi casting) the same data blocks to multiple clients (with the multicast facility, if present in the system). This is achieved by batching (grouping) requests for the same video that arrive within a short time. We explore the role of customer-waiting time and reneging behavior in selecting the video to be multicast. We show that a first come, first served (FCFS) policy that schedules the video with the longest outstanding request can perform better than the maximum queue length (MQL) policy that chooses the video with the maximum number of outstanding requests. Additionally, multicasting is better exploited by scheduling playback of the n most popular videos at predetermined, regular intervals (hence, termed FCFS-n). If user reneging can be reduced by guaranteeing that a maximum waiting time will not be exceeded, then performance of FCFS-n is further improved by selecting the regular playback intervals as this maximum waiting time. For an empirical workload, we demonstrate a substantial reduction (of the order of 60%) in the required server capacity by batching.

TI Adaptive Feedback Techniques for Synchronized Multimedia Retrieval over
   Integrated Networks
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent advances in networking, storage, and computer technologies are stimulating the development of multimedia on-demand services providing services similar to those of a neighborhood videotape rental store over metropolitan area networks. In this paper, we develop intermedia synchronization techniques for multimedia on-demand retrieval over integrated networks in the absence of global clocks. In these techniques, multimedia servers use lightweight messages called feedback units transmitted by media display sites (such as audiophones and videophones, generically referred to as mediaphones) to detect asynchronies among those sites. We present strategies by which the multimedia server can adaptively control the feedback transmission rate from that mediaphone, so as to minimize the associated overheads without permitting the asynchrony to exceed tolerable limits. We compare the performance of various resynchronization policies such as conservative, aggressive, and probabilistic. Performance evaluation of the feedback techniques indicates that their overheads are negligible; for a typical audio/video playback environment, the feedback frequency was about one in hundred. The media-specific synchronization techniques described in this paper possess an important advantage as compared to those based on clock synchronization: skipping and pausing of media units at the time of resynchronization can be based on the semantic content of the media units, thereby minimizing perceptible degradations in quality of media playback.

TI Why National Competition Policy?
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Strategies to enhance Australia's international competitiveness need to embrace reform of key infrastructure service industries, reform of the regulatory environment, industrial relations reform and taxation reform. Key aspects of this reform agenda can only be addressed through a shared commitment by all levels of government. Owner-ship of the public utilities responsible for the nation's key infrastructure networks and services is divided among commonwealth, state and territory (and local) governments. Achieving a substantial lift in the productivity of these industries and ensuring the emergence of truly national infrastructure networks relies on agreement by all governments to public utility reform and the removal of barriers to cross-border competition. Moreover, the regulation of industries, occupations and businesses is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments, hence regulatory reform also requires a cooperative approach by all governments.
   While most jurisdictions have taken some steps to reform public utilities and to deregulate certain product markets, to date reform has been piecemeal. A more systematic approach to removal of impediments to competition across the board is likely to be necessary to lift the overall competitiveness of the Australian economy. The agreement by the commonwealth and all states and territories to implement the National Competition Policy (NCP) not only provides the necessary shared commitment to reform across the board, it also provides the rewards and sanctions needed to sustain that commitment in the face of certain resistance from vested interests.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL-EDUCATION - THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CURRICULUM THROUGH
   GRASS-ROOTS RECONSTRUCTIVE ACTION
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The case study reported in this paper started as a research and development initiative to improve environmental education and ecology fieldwork activities. A package of resource materials and activities was developed and pilot-tested with teachers. Despite highly commended workshops, however, follow-up evaluation revealed that the curriculum packages were not widely used. The paper discusses a two-year action-research investigation of conceptual, evaluation and adoption tensions that led to a revised approach to environmental education and curriculum innovation. The rational and centre-to-periphery orientation of the initial research and development project was replaced by a teacher support network to facilitate 'grass-roots' reconstructive action. This orientation was then investigated with two groups of science teachers in rural schools. The study revealed how external support services and a sustained dialogue around the prevailing science curriculum, local environmental issues and everyday classroom activities fostered reconstructive change at local level. The transition from an external and rational strategy of curriculum development to a networking service in support of local reconstructive action is described. Some of the emerging management and design considerations for a revised political economy (policy and action framework) of environmental education curriculum change are discussed.

AB The article examines how small enterprises compete, cooperate, and specialise on the local level in Zimbabwe.  The analytical approach is inspired by flexible specialisation and enterprise network studies in the sense that small enterprises are examined as integral parts of their industrial and socio-cultural environment.  It is shown how current small Zimbabwean enterprises face a double weakness:  they are competing with long-established, large competitors, while there are only weak industrial and social networks among small enterprises. Against this background, the article argues that a strengthening of small enterprises requires that they relate more to the large enterprises, as sub-contractors etc., rather than clustering such relatively weak small enterprises. The large firms possess greater technological knowledge, more advanced organisational capacities, and marketing channels, from which the much weaker small enterprises can learn and thus improve their operation.  This requires, in turn, policy intervention towards the large firms.

AB Land transportation remains one of the main contributors of noise and air pollution in urban areas. This is in addition to traffic congestion and accidents which result in the loss of productive activity. While there is a close relationship between traffic volumes and levels of noise and air pollution, transport authorities often assume that solving traffic congestion would reduce noise and air pollutant levels. Tight control over automobile ownership and use in Singapore has contributed in improving traffic flows, travel speeds and air quality. The adoption of internationally accepted standards on automobile emissions and gasoline have been effective in reducing air pollution from motor vehicles. Demand management measures have largely focused on controlling the source of traffic congestion, i.e. private automobile ownership and its use especially within the Central Business District during the day. This paper reviews and analyzes the effectiveness of two measures which are instrumental in controlling congestion and automobile ownership, i.e. road pricing and the vehicle quota scheme (VQS). While these measures have been successful in achieving desired objectives, it has also led to the spreading of traffic externalities to other roads in the network, loss in consumer welfare and rent seeking by automobile traders.

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WELFARE

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; WOMEN
AB U.S. welfare reform initiatives are based on the assumption that the primary barriers to economic independence are individual deficits. However, the policy does not adequately account for situational and personal factors necessary for a successful transition from welfare to work. Without greater attention to these barriers, the policy is likely to fail or be implemented at high personal cost to recipients and their families. This paper uses a person-in-environment social systems framework to examine the personal and family resources available to a group of women who were receiving AFDC and participating in an urban Head Start program. Structured interviews and literacy assessments with 77 AFDC recipients participating in a Head Start program indicate that the barriers to self-support are not related to substance abuse, health problems, deficits in literacy, or a lack of interest in work. However, most caregivers do not have adequate training or education to prepare them to compete ill the job market, nor do they feel equipped to find a job on their own. The results with respect to family resources are mixed. While families possess a number of coping mechanisms, caregivers have little support from social network members for day-to-day child care activities. The implications of the findings for welfare policy are discussed.

ID NETWORKS; CHANNELS
AB This paper describes two protocols suitable for a multichannel, multiaccess slotted non-persistent CSMA environment for infinite population, analyses their stability and examines their throughput optimization. The common sensing multichannel slotted non-persistent CSMA (CSCSMA) protocol is an extension of the slotted single channel non-persistent CSMA protocol with an appropriate policy for the selection of the channel in which a station (re)transmits. This policy restricts the control information among the stations, and consequently reduces the cost of the station interface. Fakes's Lemma criteria are applied to define sufficient conditions for ergodicity of the Markov chain, which describes the evolution of the busy station population, and to specify regions in which the multichannel system is stable. Control parameters are the retransmission probabilities. Optimization rules are derived which show that the optimal retransmission probabilities may be expressed as a function of the number of busy stations. The separate sensing multichannel slotted non-persistent CSMA protocol (SSCSMA), using a different policy, distinguishes the channels into two groups: the retransmission channel group devoted in collision resolution; and the transmission channel group for the access of free stations. Stability regions are defined using the results for CSCSMA, and rules for optimal allocation of channels among the two groups are derived for improvement of system performance.

AB Governments throughout the Asia-Pacific region during the 1990s are increasingly seeking ways to develop research policies that target national socio-economic objectives, within an overall framework of 'sustainable development'. However, the concept of sustainable development varies from country to country and so do indicators for accounting for economic, research and development data. Research indicators in most countries remain disconnected from national strategies for sustainable development. Given the importance of research investment for social, economic and technological development, it is important to develop a model for connecting this particular investment to strategies for sustainable development.
   During the past five years the Centre for Research Policy (CRP) has been involved with many countries throughout the Asian region in developing indicators and information systems for monitoring and driving national research policies. This work has been carried out under the auspices of the UNESCO Science and Technology Policy Asian Network (STEPAN), for which CRP provides the regional focal point. The Australian government has recently commissioned CRP to carry out a study in order to develop a working definition of research relevant to ecologically sustainable development (ESD) and to develop a methodology to determine and assess indicators of the nature and level of research relevant to ESD. Practical aspects of the development of these indicators in Australia are outlined and the possible integration of these with other R&D indicators is discussed in the context of developments in the Asia-Pacific region.

ID ECONOMIES; TRANSPORT; SCALE
AB In 1986, the British government deregulated the majority of the local bus industry, cut the amount of subsidy, and privatized many public bus companies. Unit costs have declined significantly, cross-subsidies have been reduced, and there has been innovation in operating practices. However, mergers have increased concentration, and demand has declined due to the turmoil of service changes and the loss of network integration. In London,an alternative policy has been adopted whereby there is Demsetz competition for short-term monopoly rights. The paper argues that this regime will lead to greater benefits in the long run.

AB This paper develops a mathematical modeling framework for analyzing the traffic impacts of proposed tourism facilities. The estimation procedures make it possible to quantify traffic impacts in terms of the projected increase in total network travel timc/cost that would result from thc development of new facilities. The projected increase in travel cost provides a measure of the 'true'' traffic impacts bom by residents and tourists and can be used by policymakers in deciding upon transportation system altematives and/or imposing additional impact fees upon tourism developers.

AB We extend our recently developed algorithm for computing (exact) steady-state blocking probabilities for each class in product-form loss networks to cover general state-dependent arrival and service rates, This generalization allows us to consider, for the first time, a wide variety of buffered and unbuffered resource-sharing models with non-Poisson traffic, as may arise with overflows in the context of alternative routing, As before, we consider noncomplete-sharing policies involving upper-limit and guaranteed-minimum bounds for the different classes, but here we consider both bounds simultaneously, These bounds are important for providing different grades of service with protection against overloads by other classes, Our algorithm is based on numerically inverting the generating function of the normalization constant, which we derive here, Major features of the algorithm are: dimension reduction by elimination of nonbinding resources and by conditional decomposition based on special structure, an effective scaling algorithm to control errors in the inversion, efficient treatment of multiple classes with identical parameters and truncation of large sums, We show that the computational complexity of our inversion approach is usually significantly lower than the alternative recursive approach.

TI EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN TECHNICAL CHANGE IN
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS - 10 NATIONAL ECONOMIES COMPARED
SO TECHNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In all the countries examined in this paper, the government is- directly or indirectly - involved in the system of telecommunications research and development (R&D). All these governments' policies tend to create market distortions, yet there is little in common between the ten countries that are compared. Among them, different working divisions have evolved between industry, network operators and state establishments for R&D in the telecommunications field. This paper highlights the diversity of structures present in some important industrial countries.  A comprehensive measurement system for R&D efficiency in telecommunications is currently not available. This paper thus presents and discusses a set Of quantitative, but non-monetary, indicators such as R&D expenditure, R&D personnel, scientific publications, patents and turnover. Expert assessments are added to this indicator system so as to overcome the incomplete links between them, their poor correlation with one another, and data availability problems.
   The quantitative findings are quite discouraging for both technology policy and R&D management. Most of the current preconceptions are not justified when measured carefully. Cross-wise, all possible correlations between government and network operator R&D contributions have been checked against world market shares, and the like. No significant correlations were found, and thus the future technological competitive position is likely to remain the same whether there is more or less government intervention in national R&D systems. In addition, vertical integration and the intensity of R&D cooperation between national network companies and the related manufacturers do not result in typical success patterns between R&D and commercialization. There is no optimum, and no really disadvantaged setting for regulatory or business environments. Finally, it is important to note that the introduction of the formal framework of science and technology indicators within the sensitive area of modem telecommunications R&D may be regarded as a facility to assist objective assessments derived from expert interviews, and may enlighten economic studies of the Schumpeterian type.

AB A key element in the process of European integration is that of Trans-European Networks which will affect the poorer peripheral states of the existing Community, potential new members in East and Central Europe, but also have considerable significance for the congested central regions. There is a recognition of the need for considerable infrastructural investment, which will have considerable implications for both the inter- and intra-regional distribution of economic activity and which address to two central concerns of cohesion and subsidiarity. This paper examines the scope and nature of the transport TENs proposed and analyses the problems posed by these changes and the options for policy within the EC, especially that on the development of the Community's regions. The paper argues that such an approach requires a careful definition of measures of accessibility which relate to both intra- and inter-regional access; to all modes of transport, reflecting a region's economic structure and transport needs; and to levels Of service on infrastructure. It concludes that an increasing emphasis on the Community significance of new transport infrastructure will be needed for both planning and financial reasons, especially given the increasing emphasis on environmental considerations in transport, but that this implies increasing tensions at the regional level which will need to be addressed in the interests of cohesion.

AB A critical evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses associated with the 'minimal set' approach to designing an optimal reserve network for vertebrate species is offered. Strengths are the rational and efficient manner in which full species representation is achieved, and the planning benefits that can be gained through its flexibility. Weaknesses include the inappropriateness of the 'minimal set' as a framework for a reserve network, and the frequent confusion between top-down relational species criteria and bottom-up site attributes. It is suggested that the distinct 'top-down' relational and 'bottom-up' representation approaches may act synergistically to form the basis of a National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy. These complementary approaches may require different forms of protection and monitoring, but could also be amalgamated to develop a conservation strategy for non-protected areas. Sufficient attention should also be paid to encouraging the free flow of information and to incorporating the principles of taxonomic and environmental uncertainty into future conservation policies.

AB We present a conceptual framework for metropolitan opportunity and a model of individual decision making about issues affecting youth's future socioeconomic status. Decision making and its geographic context have objective and subjective aspects. Objective spatial variations occur in the metropolitan opportunity structure-social systems, markets, and institutions that aid upward mobility. Decisions are based on the decision-maker's values, aspirations, preferences, and subjective perceptions of possible outcomes, which are all shaped by the local social network (e.g., kin, neighbors, and friends).
   We also review the psychological literature on decision making. We hypothesize that the decision-making method varies with the range of opportunities considered: Those with fewer options adopt a less considered method wherein mistakes and short-term focus are more likely. Our review also finds empirical evidence that the local social network has an important effect on youth's decisions regarding education, fertility, work, and crime. Policy implications are discussed.

AB Since 1982, a national veterinary network has been involved in the monitoring of resistance to antimicrobial agents in the main pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased cattle in France. It is based on 40 regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories and managed by a central reference laboratory (CNEVA Lyon). Highly standardized methods are used in the diagnostic laboratories. This network collects up-to-date information on antimicrobial resistance in veterinary isolates and gathers strains for specific studies on fastidious bacteria and for the analysis of mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics. Such a permanent survey is essential to establish a rational veterinary antibiotic policy. It could be connected to other compatible systems developed in other fields such as human medicine, food, and environment, to evaluate the importance of resistance and R-factors spread for public health. The limits and perspectives of this surveillance system are discussed.

TI Access Control In Multicast Packet Switching
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
LA English
DT Article
AB The subject of the paper is the access control and performance of multicast packet switching in a broadband network environment. In terms of scheduling the transmission of the copies of the packet onto output ports, two basic service disciplines have been defined, (1) one-shot scheduling-all the copies transmitted in the same time slot and (2) call splitting-transmission over several time slots. As subcategories of call splitting, SS (strict-sense) specifies that each packet can send at most one copy to the destination per time slot; WS (wide-sense) does not carry this restriction. We propose a novel scheme, revision scheduling, which mitigates the HOL blocking effect by sequentially combining the one-shot scheduling and the call splitting disciplines. This paper introduces output contention resolution implementations, in the form of combinational logic circuits which are designed to resolve output contentions arising in each of the call scheduling disciplines, by incorporating a cyclic priority access policy. Also, a neural network based contention resolution algorithm is proposed to demonstrate the improvement of the optimal scheduling.

Unlike the conventional request-response paradigm, such applications involve a single source sending delay-sensitive information to a large number of users scattered across a high-speed wide area network. Communication requirements of such applications are distinct from those based on conventional client-server interactions because the multimedia information demands certain Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees in terms of delay constraints and error tolerance. In this paper, we address some of the research issues that must be resolved before we can realize large scale dissemination services across a high-speed WAN. In particular, we argue for an end-to-end approach in which transport and upper-layer protocol cooperate to provide a large scale dissemination service using a best-effort multicast delivery service provided by the under-lying network layer. Under an end-to-end approach, a transport protocol takes into account application-level error recovery semantics in its flow and error control strategies to ensure delivery of multimedia information within the QoS constraints of a given distributed multimedia application. We have designed QMTP, a new multicast transport protocol that provides a simplex (unidirectional), rate controlled, quasi-reliable multicast transport mechanism for large scale dissemination of multimedia information. The paper describes our goals, the research issues that must be solved, our information dissemination model, QMTP flow and error control policies, and results of our performance evaluation.

AB This analysis shows that the Brazilian State's decreased skill in and capacity for intervening (that is, the governability crisis) derive from the breakdown of interest networks and from the inadequacy of alternative structures (such as the party system) that accompany the government's process of retrenchment. Because the government is weak in the three governability factors - autonomy, concentration, mobilization - it can only incompletely and unsatisfactorily enforce economic liberalization and privatization measures, which are taken here as examples of analysis. Divided, the private sector is incapable of reacting. While the capacity of the State diminishes, this is not offset by any concomitant increase in the private sector's dynamism and competitive flexibilization. This erosion of the State is the manifestation of a process of retrenchment, allied to a net loss in State capacity for intervening, and can be understood as the non-feasibility of rebuilding interest networks. Given the State structure and the climate for sectoral mobilization, no type of working arrangement can be achieved.

TI Block loss reduction in ATM networks
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE quality of service; ATM networks; block loss rate
AB Traditional approaches to guaranteeing Quality-of-Service (QoS) in ATM networks have focused on performance metrics such as cell loss probability, end-to-end cell delay and delay jitter. However, the block loss rate is a more meaningful metric for applications such as medical imaging and real-time video, and for high-level protocols such as IP which will use ATM as the transport mechanism. A block is defined as a group of consecutive ATM cells. For instance, a block may correspond to an IP datagram or to a macroblock within a medical image. A block loss occurs when a single cell from a block is lost. Consequently, we propose a technique for reducing block loss in ATM networks. Our method combines two well-studied approaches for minimizing the impact of information loss during transport over ATM networks which have been considered independently of each other in the past: priority-based cell discarding and forward error correction (FEC). We present a simple analysis which shows that our scheme could potentially reduce the block loss rate by several orders of magnitude for many cases of interest. We also formulate and solve a constrained optimization problem that can be used by a call admission control mechanism to determine optimal operating parameters. The analysis that we present is known to be somewhat optimistic since in reality cell losses in ATM-based networks are highly correlated. Consequently, we conduct extensive tests of the scheme via simulation. We also propose and study a buffer management algorithm which we call Adaptive Pushout (ADP) that accounts for correlations between cell losses. The ADP algorithm reduces block loss rates to near-optimal levels. We consider further performance enhancements to the ADP policy that deliver excellent performance even under very heavy load. Practical implementation issues for the various schemes suggested in this paper are also addressed.

TI Rethinking state rail policy: The benefits of rail preservation include
   more than jobs
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In the last two decades, many states established rail promotion programs in an effort to limit the contraction of their railroad networks. Now federal funds for rail projects are nearly exhausted, and states must decide whether to expand considerably their levels of internal finding for short line investments. Such a decision requires a careful articulation of policy goals, combined with sound cost-benefit techniques. Research shows, however that states often fail to evaluate the full range of costs and benefits when considering rail investments. instead, the economic development benefits of local rail service frequently are overstated, while the potential for rail investments to meet broader transportation planning needs is neglected. This paper evaluates the rationale behind state intervention in the rail industry, discusses the tendency of states to focus on economic development to the exclusion of other benefits categories and presents summary results from an analysis of an investment project in North Carolina. The paper suggests that state funding for rail projects is more likely to be justified based on intermodal substitution benefits generated by local rail service, rather than the railroads' potential to increase jobs.

TI EXPERIENCES IN PROVIDING A WHITE PAGES DIRECTORY SERVICE BASED ON THE
   X500 STANDARD
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is based on the author's experience of designing a white pages user interface to the X.500 Directory. The paper examines two issues. First, a number of problems arose during the design process which are perceived as being due to inadequacies in the 1988 protocol and service interface. In cases where these issues have been addressed in the 1992/3 standard, the proposed remedies are noted.
   Second, whilst access to an X.500 directory service is by protocols which have been standardised, the environment in which it runs can vary in many ways: hardware and network infrastructure; directory information tree structure; naming policies; access policies; data coverage and management; effort required for system management. However, new users of the Directory have no knowledge of this lack of uniformity, and often, quite reasonably, expect a fully populated Directory with all information accessible at high-speed. The paper suggests a range of approaches to help the directory user cope with this diversity: some of the recommendations require service agreements and coordination, whilst others have implications for user interface design.

AB Since implementing economic reforms in 1979, China's economy, spurred by foreign investment has been growing at an average annual rate of ten percent. Unfortunately for companies doing business in China, reliable connections to telecommunications and computer networks have only recently become available in the major cities and are non-existent in most of the country. In response, the Chinese government has made the development of an information infrastructure a high priority, but ifs efforts have been hindered by conflicting political and business interests. In this paper we look at two aspects of the development of an information infrastructure in China: telecommunications development and the Internet. Currently the central government maintains tight control over telecommunications development, but this control is quickly breaking down. The Internet in China has been developing in a totally separate environment, largely out of the control of the central government; but recent policy changes have brought strict controls over the Internet. This paper presents at China's progress toward a national information infrastructure in light of the political and economic conflict.

TI The economic impact of transport infrastructure provision: A review of
   the evidence
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
AB The economic impacts of transport infrastructure have been extensively debated in Great Britain in recent years. Positive impacts are generated by the construction of infrastructure, although these are usually less marked for civil engineering schemes compared with other forms of construction, Transport infrastructure is an essential contributing factor in the industrial development of economies, but once infrastructure networks have been created economic impacts arising from the provision of additional infrastructure capacity will be small on average unless there are significant technological discontinuities. In such a steady-state situation, the long-term macro-economic impacts of transport infrastructure provision are difficult to prove and many of the benefits can be secured by government more cost-effectively with a different mix of policies, Notwithstanding these conclusions, infrastructure provision has an essential contribution to make to the quality and sustainability of life in societies and the attainment of environmental goals.

AB The debate about the future of the Canadian information highway has revealed that the rules for the protection of personal information are incomplete and incoherent. The federal government has now recognized that this regulatory patchwork will fail to allay the growing concerns of the general public, will not satisfy emerging international standards, and will create enormous costs for businesses that need to transfer personal data from one jurisdiction to another. Slowly beginning to take shape is a Canadian privacy protection policy that emphasizes the use of all instruments within the ''toolkit'' of privacy protection. It recognizes that voluntary action from the bottom up is just as necessary as regulatory action from the top down. It embraces innovations in new privacy-enhancing technologies and instruments from the world of standards-setting and certification. Fundamentally however, the government has recognized that only a comprehensive legislative framework (based on the recently adopted Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information negotiated through the Canadian Standards Association) will provide the necessary protections in the networked and distributed computer environment of the information highway.

AB Homelessness is one of the most pressing social problems today.  Society has responded to the problem with the creation of homeless shelters.  Yet, the nature of the operation of the shelter is not defined.  This study explored the operations of two single adult homeless shelters to understand how they operate in addressing the problem of homelessness.  The study identified two different types of services, one called ''house'' and the other ''home''.  House services provided basic food, shelter, and linkage to social services, which fulfilled the basic definition of the problem of homelessness as defined by the Institute of Medicine.  Home services provided the basic services of house but also went one step beyond by providing these services within the context of a supportive environment, thus creating informal social supports.  The study discusses the implications of each of these modalities in addressing the problems associated with people who are homeless as well as the differences in policies and structures which contribute to one shelter providing house and the other home services.

TI Do female-headed households have different shelter needs than men? The
   case of Monrovia, Liberia
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE FAMILY STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Through analysis of survey data of male and female heads of households in low-income settlements in Monrovia, Liberia, the authors explore the shelter and related needs of female-headed households. The findings show that while women represent the poorest families in the settlements, they obtained shelter of similar quality to that of men. African women use family labor, personal savings and their support network to obtain shelter for themselves and their families. Further analysis show that women were more likely to become homeowners then men. Obtaining shelter allows women to generate income and provide shelter for themselves and their children. Analysis of community needs show that women heads of households have the same needs of men. They want sewer systems, toilets, water, health clinics and schools - infrastructure and services they cannot provide for themselves. We hope the research presented will assist government leaders and the donor community in designing appropriate housing policies that will include a growing segment of human settlements, households headed by women with dependent children and adults.

AB Communication is the cornerstone of ecosystem protection and sustainable development efforts in the binational Great Lakes region of North America. Great Lakes environmental protection, remediation, and pollution prevention efforts bring together individuals from across The public sector, business and industry, citizens groups, and academia. The region is now working to enhance communications between these groups and the rest of the world, through the Internet-based Great Lakes Information Network (GLIN). Diverse regional data, information, and human resources located at key agencies and organizations are accessible via GLIN. These online resources span environmental quality, human health effects and other research, resource management, transportation, demographic, and economic data, as well as other resources in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. Federal, state, provincial, and regional agencies and a range of citizen, business, and research organizations are cooperating with the lead agency, the Great Lakes Commission, in developing GLIN into the region's shared Internet resource. GLIN resources are accessible to users of ubiquitous Internet research tools including World Wide Web and Gopher. Statistical information on usage and the region's response to ongoing efforts to build the GLIN system and solicit contributions of data and information indicate that we can continue to build GLIN into a truly regional resource which enhances communication among researchers, policy makers, students, and the general public.

   MANAGEMENT; LEAN PRODUCTION
AB Quality constitutes the core of successful business operations in marker and manufacturing. It assures problem solving designed for the customer, on a long-term basis, a systemically and strategically planned development. Quality represents a strategic factor of its own. It has not only to be planned and built in, but also carefully grown according to long-term perspectives. 'Total' quality is equal to 'systemic'. Its design and control pervades all phases of operation and management alike as a key factor of market leadership. In the industrial practice, hence, quality concepts are closely linked to the philosophy of a lean enterprise. 'Lean' enhances policies as e.g. competitiveness through flexibility and time advantage, high efficiency production and Kaizen, i.e. continuous improvement of all quality originating faculties. There are chances and possible pitfalls e.g. of outsourcing and JIT. Overloading the human resources for a better operating efficiency may result in personnel troubles. Experiences are carefully evaluated and transferred into a steadily improving self-control of quality operations. Systemic quality management will pursue a long-term optimum of quality through a philosophy of strategic quality assurance, which  considers all the mutual influences and outbalances all parameters within the quality network. The worldwide interconnectivity of e.g. customer protection, ecology and (inter-)national economic policies (GATT, EC) poses global challenges. They will be met only by a policy of active and creative quality.

AB At a time when the informatics and telecommunications industries are looking for new markets to exploit in relation, for example, to the emerging ISDN and broadband communications networks, there is a need to create a broad consensus in Europe by bringing together systematically the relevant industries including telecom service providers, health care providers, insurance organisations, standardisation experts and policy makers. The aim of the ACOSTA (Consensus Formation and Standardisation Promotion) Accompanying Measure is the creation of more general awareness of the relevant environment among all the parties, better specification of common requirements and options taking better account of the real needs of the users, and enlargement of the common market in health care telematics.

ID CORRUPTION
AB The article argues that the adoption and persistence of many failed inward-looking development strategies can be attributed to political clientelism. A political system consisting of aggregations of patron-client networks bound together by the exchange of material benefits for political support is liable to be dominated by factionalism, politicisation, a high level of administrative corruption and a low degree of legitimacy and autonomy. In such an environment, welfare-reducing inward-looking development strategies result from the attempt to satisfy the demands of political supporters. The analysis suggests that political changes can be a prerequisite to a permanent transition to superior development strategies, and thus to the success of structural reform programmes.

TI Freight transport in Western Europe: The case for using new units of
   measurement
SO TRANSPORTATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB European organizations currently use ton-kilometers to measure levels of freight transport by various modes. However this unit of measurement provides a misleading picture of the relative importance of each mode to the European economy and the physical presence of each mode in the transportation network. Therefore, the ''turnover'', or economic value in monetary units, should be used to measure the importance of each mode to the economy. Likewise, vehicle-miles should be used to measure the physical impacts of freight transport. The use of ton-miles as a unit of measurement and has significant impacts upon European freight transport policy, and should be abandoned in favor of these more acurate measurements.

DT Article
AB In the public policy discourse on telecommunications infrastructure there is a constant lament about the fragmentation and chaos within the regulatory environment in the USA. It is often suggested that 'top-down' network models are far more efficient than the 'bottom-up' approach which characterizes US domestic telecommunications. The recent successes of more centralized countries lend support to this perspective. However, the analysis presented in this paper suggests that the USA should refrain from copying the success formulae of other countries. The US cultural context is very different from other countries' and therefore there is a need to develop an indigenous strategy which is more suitable for a markedly polycentric environment.

AB The Xpress Transfer Protocol (XTP) offers new functionality and performance for modern distributed applications. Recently adopted by the United States Department of Defense for use in military mission-critical systems, XTP provides a rich set of communications mechanisms without forcing the user to adopt a predefined communications policy. The user is free to choose those XTP mechanisms which implement whatever communications paradigm best suits the user's application. In this paper, we discuss the background for XTP's invention, the motivation and rationale for developing a new transport and network layer protocol, the specific functional and performance advantages which XTP provides, and we describe the types of applications for which XTP has proven suitable.

AB Cable TV, a tool for catalysing the foreign satellites programme invasion from the skies, in the absence of any regulations in India, registered a mushroom growth and has today become a house-hold service. The sluggish policy making mechanism, initially opposed to Dish Antennae, the major signal source in Cable TV, in spirit, suddenly nose-dived to support transportation of Doordarshan Metro bonanza to the viewers via the cable route. This ex-post-facto reconciliation is to be viewed with caution in the light of a hurriedly presented Cable TV regulatory bill introduced in the parliament. This paper has endeavoured presentation of a bird's-eye-view of the perspective on this novel phenomenon and the profession of cable television network operation.

SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB The resource-rich countries in ASEAN and similar countries in the Tropical Zone are faced with three environmental problems: exhaustion and degradation of their terrestrial ecosystems, degradation of the coastal environment and its ecosystem, and environmental pollution due to industrial and urban wastes.
   A critical problem in these countries, however, is the shortage of trained and experienced manpower to implement policies and programs for natural resource management and pollution control, particularly in the country-side.
   There is a clear need for encouraging, even institutionalizing, close and effective collaboration between the education sector and environment agencies towards the goal of incorporating environmental education and training as an essential component of the development process.
   It is suggested that one suitable strategy to respond to this challenge is the establishment of a network of regional centres of environmental education and training. These centres, hosted by a regional university preferably the most prestigious in the region, will perform five inter-related functions, namely: research and information dissemination, training, advisory services, monitoring, and conducting pilot or demonstration projects.

TI DYNAMIC GROUND-HOLDING POLICIES FOR A NETWORK OF AIRPORTS
SO TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The yearly congestion costs in the U.S. airline industry are estimated to be of the order of $2 billion.  In [6] we introduced and studied generic integer programming models for the static multi-airport ground-holding problem (GHP), the problem of assigning optimal ground holding delays in a general network of airports, so that the total (ground plus airborne) delay cost of all flights is minimized.  The present paper is the first attempt to address the multi-airport GHP in a dynamic environment.  We propose algorithms to update ground-holding decisions as time progresses and more accurate weather (hence capacity) forecasts become available.  We propose several pure IP formulations (most of them 0-1), which have the important advantages of being remarkably compact while capturing the essential aspects of the problem and of being sufficiently flexible to accommodate various degrees of modeling detail.  For example, one formulation allows the dynamic updating of the mix between departure and arrival capacities by modifying runway use.  These formulations enable one to assign and dynamically update ground holds to a sizeable portion of the network of the major congested U.S. or European airports.  We also present structural insights on the behavior of the problem by means of computational results, and we find that our methods perform much better than a heuristic which may approximate, to some extent, current ground-holding practices.

TI TRAFFIC FLOW PROBLEMS IN EUROPE
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The first purpose of this paper is to examine the causes of the present shortcomings of the European transport network. There are two main reasons for the problems now experienced with respect to the flow of traffic on certain transport infrastructures, namely changes in traffic trends in terms of both quantity and structure, and the deficiencies of the investment policy (lack of co-ordination, less expenditure on infrastructure). After describing in detail the main bottlenecks now found on the European network of transport infrastructure, some indication is given of probable future trends in this connection. On the basis of the growth expected in economic activity and the changes under way in the countries of Eastern Europe, it would seem highly likely that road traffic will increase at a far more rapid pace than the overall capacity of the transport infrastructure available and so be conducive to much more congestion. Given this pattern of development, a number of different measures might be taken, such as the building of new infrastructure, the alteration of modal split, better use of existing infrastructure, industrial redeployment, etc. The paper concludes by endeavouring to assess these measures.

AB Elsewhere we have presented a traveling-wave analysis of HIV transmission on a tightly self-interactive, geographically-focused core group social network (Wallace R. Soc. Sci. Med. 32, 847, 1991; Soc. Sci. Med. 33, 1155, 1991; Environ. Plan. A. 26, 767, 1994; Wallace R. and Fullilove M. Environ. Plan. A. 23, 1701 1991). Here we reanalyze the problem in probability space and recover a close analog of the Shannon Coding Theorem of information theory. Subsequent direct application of information-theoretic methods provides striking insight regarding the spread of disease along the sociogeographic networks of marginalized subgroups, suggesting that 'risk behaviors' for infection may constitute essential components of a behavioral code for the transmission of information within the noisy channel of a marginalized community's social networks. The code's form, including the incorporation of risk behaviors, arises as a direct consequence of the external oppressive forces which structure marginalization.
   This viewpoint suggests an explanation of the sometime-observed rapid transmission of both infection and of control strategies for infection along the same network, but suggests further that if risk behaviors are indeed parts of a behavioral code for the transmission of group norms, statements of individual worth or resource sharing, then high rates of relapse are inevitable, given the persistence of the external oppression which gives those behaviors symbolic value.
   We suggest that violent acts in particular may emerge as key behavioral symbols for 'sending a message' in socially disorganized communities, implying that school-based or other individual-oriented harm reduction strategies for violence prevention, in the absence of a comprehensive, multifactorial reform program, cannot significantly reverse the effects of continuing economic and social constraints or of public policies of planned shrinkage and benign neglect, factors primarily responsible for the disorganization of urban minority communities within the United States.

TI INTEGRATED WATER AND WETLAND MANAGEMENT - TOWARDS A PROJECT APPROACH

LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT INTERNATIONAL CONF ON THE PEOPLES ROLE IN WETLAND MANAGEMENT
CY JUN 05-08, 1989
CL LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS
AB The management problem of wetlands is the central subject.  Integrated water management may be considered a prerequisite for integrated wetland management.  An analytical framework for wetland management is presented, based on a distinction between problem field and management field.  The problem field is a coherent set of problems, in this case discrepancies between actual wetland qualities and requirements as to its qualities.  The management field comprises all the relevant actors and their interventions.  Hence, both the actors with a specific management task (the "managers") and those affecting the wetland by using its resources (the interest groups) are part of the management field.
   The divergence of wetland characteristics necessitates the selection of a management strategy adapted to the local or regional circumstances. Such a management strategy must be based on characteristics of the problem field and on characteristics of the management network. It may be stated that ineffective management of wetlands therefore results from either:  (1) the intricacy of the problem field; (2) the complexity of the management field; or (3) the relation between management field and problem field.
   A possible solution to this ineffectiveness may be found in an integrated management plan.  This can be defined as a policy document in which management objectives are formulated, as well as the outlines of tasks and responsibilities of all actors essential for realizing these objectives.  For the present management authorities a project approach may act as a catalyst, as it facilitates the attack of pressing management problems.

AB A new network design algorithm for improving the reliability of groundwater simulation model predictions is developed. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the simulation model prediction variance by choice of new aquifer property measurement locations. This method, which uses parameter measurements to minimize prediction error, is different in concept from conventional parameter estimation or inverse methods which use state variable measurements to minimize parameter estimation error. The variance of predicted state variables, hydraulic head and contaminant concentration, is used as a measure of model prediction reliability. Prediction variance depends on the extent and quality of aquifer property measurements used to estimate simulation model parameters. Kriging is used in the first-order uncertainty analysis to estimate the model parameters. First-order uncertainty analysis is used in the algorithm to compute the prediction variance and select new measurement locations. A network design example is presented, the results of which show that a significant increase in simulation model prediction reliability is achieved by measuring aquifer properties at locations selected by the algorithm. The predicted mean was found to be insensitive to new measurements, while the predicted state variable variance was found to be quite sensitive to new measurements. The selection of measurement locations was found to be greatly affected by the type and extent of boundary conditions existing in the aquifer. Fixed value boundary conditions tend to reduce prediction variance in the neighborhood of new measurements and throughout the entire aquifer. Specified flux and mixed boundary conditions tend to reduce prediction variance in the neighborhood of the measurement locations, with little reduction occurring in other areas of the aquifer. The results also indicate that both the mean head and concentration are relatively insensitive to the number of data points in the network as long as there is a good estimate of the statistics of the ln (K) distribution and covariance function. This is not the case with the standard deviation of both the head and concentration which are significantly affected by the addition of data points to the network.

TI THE CHANNEL TUNNEL AND REGIONAL-DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE - AN OVERVIEW

AB This paper provides an overview of the possible regional development effects across Europe of the Channel Tunnel. It identifies the regional significance of the tunnel in the context of the emergent European Capitals region of the European Community, but as part of a total network as well as simply improving one fink. The paper proceeds to review the conflicting effects of changes in infrastructure provision on output and production, but also to emphasize the potential importance of more subjective evaluations of the tunnel's impact. This leads to a discussion of the regional policy implications, identified at a local, national and EC level. The paper concludes that the regional development implications are still not clear and will continue to depend on how individual decision-makers and policy-makers respond to the opportunities presented. In particular, there is no clear evidence for infrastructure such as the Channel Tunnel leading to increased concentration of economic activity in core regions at the expense of the periphery, but it may, however, be part of a process of concentration within core regions as a result of the increasing accessibility of the metropolitan areas.

TI ISSUES IN PUBLIC-ACCESS - THE SOLOMONS CONFERENCES
SO GOVERNMENT PUBLICATIONS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1991 and 1992, officials in the offices of information resources management in several federal agencies held interagency conferences on public access to electronic government information. The conferences were held at Solomons, Maryland, and became known as the Solomons conferences. The first conference, sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency in May 1991, consisted principally of the sharing of ideas and experience with regard to agency information dissemination programs. The second conference, sponsored by the Department of Agriculture in November 1991, concentrated on the question: under what conditions should the public have online access to federal computers? An outcome of the second Solomons conference was a working draft policy framework on public access to government electronic information. In July 1992, the author sponsored a public/private sector dialogue to critique the draft policy framework. The dialogue addressed questions such as: Who is(are) the public(s)?; security controls and public access; value enhancement in the public sector; user charges and restrictions on redissemination; and networks and public access. The public/private sector dialogue served as input to the third Solomons conference, sponsored by the Department of Commerce in September 1992. The third conference concentrated more on cost recovery and pricing of information products.

TI MANAGING BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WITH INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
SO AI APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Management of biological diversity is an integral component of ecologically sustainable development and the international Convention on Biological Diversity. To manage biological diversity, government agencies must be able to locate diverse sources of information quickly and interpret these data intelligently. Advanced information management systems (e.g., machine learning and ''intelligent'' systems) can help governments do this. We developed an information strategy for management of biological diversity, using Australian forest systems as a case study. We used an advanced technology framework (open system architecture) supporting development and upgrading of information management facilities, access to electronic data through computer networks and information management systems, and agreed-upon information standards. Such an information environment must be relatively friendly for end users of the information, such as land-use decision and policy makers and resource managers. Our seven-layered open work-flow model integrates a number of intelligent information systems to help scientists provide timely and comprehensive advice on biological diversity. The model supplies a conceptual basis for the evolution of biology diversity information systems.

TI DETERMINANTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION WITH REGARD TO CLIMATIC-CHANGE
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The study of human dimensions of global climatic change is still in the initial stage of development. Several attempts have been undertaken to define sensible research strategies in the field but until now relatively little empirical work has been undertaken and there is a lack of sound theoretical arguments. The present paper presents a theory-based empirical study of determinants influencing the probability that somebody takes climate-relevant environmental action. Important methodological differences between current models of climate dynamics and models of human reality are discussed in order to build three models of climate-related environmental action. A model focussed on the information transfer from science to the public at large is compared with a model focussed on sociodemographic characteristics and with a model focussed on socio-cultural variables like interpersonal rules and social networks. The hypothesis that the latter model is strongly superior to the former ones is tested and confirmed. Some implications for interdisciplinary cooperation and for policy making arc discussed.

AB ''Commercial Key Escrow (CKE)'', and an earlier ''Software Key Escrow (SKE) scheme, have been proposed by Trusted Information Systems Inc. (TIS) in the USA as a possible compromise scheme to meet the demands of commerce and industry for new levels of information security, particularly transaction and message confidentiality in an international and national networked environment, while meeting law enforcement demands for continued effectiveness of telecommunications line-tapping ability. These latter requirements relate to the perceived need by law enforcement agencies to make use of legitimate authorised line-tapping capabilities for the gathering of appropriate intelligence and/or evidence for the purpose of fulfilling perceived roles in the protection of society from criminal activity against the potential case where such line-taps produce intercepts that are encrypted. CKE, involving the incorporation of software based cryptography in computer and network systems with associated key recovery data transmitted during data network activity and provision of ''Data Recovery Centres (DRC)'', is seen as presenting a new solution to the problems encountered in the USA with the ''Clipper'' initiative in that country announced in 1993.
   This paper examines the CKE/SKE proposals in an Australian and international context and sets the proposal against the more general debate on cryptography, its technology and usage, and public policy. A likely scenario is suggested for Australia involving the incorporation of backup and recovery and network directory services into the encryption scheme and the use of Australia Post, and indeed any national post office structure, as an ideal candidate for trials of both the technology and public/business acceptance of this overall structure. More basic principles of ''freedom-of-speech'' are also raised in conjunction with this overall analysis of a concrete proposal.

ID RISK
AB This paper presents a mathematical model for the optimal simultaneous siting and routing of hazardous-waste transport, storage. and disposal operations. Siting hazardous-waste disposal facilities and the subsequent routing of hazardous waste from multiple points of origin is a complex problem involving environmental engineering, economic, and safety issues. The model presented explicitly considers hazardous-waste routing and operational costs in the facility siting process. The formulation presented represents a linear flow model driven by both cost and fisk considerations. To demonstrate this model, an example using a hypothetical siting and transportation network for a 10-month planning horizon is presented. In addition, a multiobjective formulation of the model is formulated and solved for incorporating risks associated with the transport, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The model can be used to aid engineers and local and state agencies in the siting of hazardous-waste facilities and in evaluating alternative routing and siting policies with respect to cost and risk.

AB The realization of the ideology of the sustainable development needs very strongly the ecological cognizance to be an integral part of the awareness of each individual in given living conditions in order to understand the most proper (sustainable) utilization of those conditions. However, the natural way of achieving that awareness has been in an urbanized and overtechnologized society interrupted. Therefore it should be forced by spreading of ecological knowledge and education. The paper contains selected important points belonging to the basic instrumentarium of ecological awareness, as the understanding of the term ecology, the new approach to the nature and nature protection, the consciousness on ecological stability and ecological networks up to the implementation of those issues to the real ecological policy of Slovak Republic since 1990.

TI Monitoring networks in fractured rocks: A decision analysis approach
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
ID WASTE MANAGEMENT SITES; GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION; ENGINEERING DESIGN;
   REGULATORY POLICY
AB Hydrogeological decision analysis is applied to the design of a performance monitoring network at a waste management facility overlying fractured bedrock. The objective of the monitoring system is to detect contaminants before they reach a regulatory compliance boundary in order to enable early and less costly on-site remediation, and avoid the potentially more costly consequences of failure. Features in the design of the monitoring network include the number of monitoring wells to be installed and their locations, where in each borehole to position discrete monitoring zones, and how often to take water samples. The decision model identifies the preferred monitoring strategy as the design alternative, among all those considered, that minimizes the sum of the monitoring costs and the expected costs of failure and on-site remediation. At a given distance from the facility, the highest probabilities of plume detection are obtained when the fractures intersecting the borehole wall that carry the largest flows are monitored. Monitoring intervals centered on fractures with highest aperture, or regions of highest fracture density, yield intermediate values, while intervals located at predetermined depths yield the lowest probabilities of detection. The monitoring scheme with the highest probability of detection is not necessarily the preferred monitoring strategy. For monitoring options that have a higher probability of detection than the preferred monitoring strategy, the higher expected cost of on-site remediation, when combined with the increased cost of monitoring required to provide the higher probability of detection, can outweigh the reduction in the expected cost of failure brought about by a higher probability of detection. When the probability of contaminants migrating to the compliance boundary is small during the compliance period, changes in the probability of detection brought about by a more intense monitoring effort do not affect the expected cost of failure much; in these instances, the decision model may point to a reduced effort in performance monitoring.

TI The meaning of home for older women in rural Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL ON AGEING
LA English
DT Article
AB Policies targeting community care of older people in Australia are predicated partly on the belief that home is a place of particular meaning to them. This research examines the meaning of home for older women living in the community in rural Australia. A life historical perspective is taken on the assumption that the significance of home is located in a network of meanings constructed over the lifetime of women interviewed. It is claimed that home and identity for these women are integrally linked. Home is a locus for experiencing power over the environment and connection with others in real and symbolic ways. The experience and expression of power and connectedness is modulated by marital status, living arrangement and physical location.

TI Design for environment attributes of the AT&T 5ESS(R) switch
SO AT&T TECHNICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB AT&T's goal is to be a leader in applying sound environmental policies in the manufacture and operations of its products. To provide a benchmark assessment for one of AT&T's major product lines, this paper reviews the design for environment (DFE) attributes of the AT&T 5ESS(R) switch. Although formal DFE processes did not start in 5ESS design until 1993, the efforts thus far have resulted in a 5ESS design and assembly process that is environmentally responsible. This benchmarking exercise also is an opportunity to identify items in design and assembly that can be improved on, and modifications suggested by this review are now being made to the design rules used by AT&T Network Systems' physical designers.

   SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID MASS-EXCHANGE NETWORKS
AB The purpose of this work is to develop a systematic and generally applicable methodology for the optimal design of recycle/reuse process networks for reducing the emission of hydrogen sulfide from pulp and paper plants. The problem is formulated as an optimal synthesis task with the objective of minimizing the total annualized cost of the processes used for the waste minimization task while satisfying all environmental requirements. A systematic procedure is developed in which tradeoffs between cost and waste reduction are established. A key tool for this procedure is the recently developed technique of synthesizing mass-exchange networks. This approach allows for the simultaneous screening of all potential hydrogen sulfide recovery technologies. Such separation technologies includes those employing internal (process) resources as well as external resources. Internal resources correspond to mass-separating agents that are available in a pulp-and-paper plant which can be used for the removal/recovery of hydrogen sulfide from the waste streams. On the other hand, external resources refer to streams that are not involved in the pulp-and-paper process but may be-purchased for use in recovering hydrogen sulfide from air emission streams. A case study is solved to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. The results of this case study clearly indicate the economic advantage of using white liquor for hydrogen sulfide removal in emission streams compared to alternative removal technologies and destruction (incineration) techniques.

AB A heuristic approach based on facility location theory effectively augments groundwater quality monitoring configurations through the strategic siting of additional wells.  The approach is an alternative to variance-based schemes previously established for the augmentation problem.  The method developed herein is practical in that it (1) is relatively easily understood, (2) is not difficult to implement and solve, and (3) does not require a large number of preexisting observation points.  The approach has been applied to a case study involving a landfill-contaminated buried valley aquifer in southwest Ohio.  Configurations derived by the heuristic approach exhibit two key characteristics:  (1) location of wells near areas of high estimated contaminant concentration and (2) interwell separation distances that facilitate areal plume coverage.

AB Homelessness in today's urban centers poses a problem of huge proportions. Increasingly, the homeless and the urban dilemma are intertwined. Cause and effect are blurred as the needs of the homeless confront and affront while shaping urban policy. Because of the diverse nature and needs of the American homeless population individual organizations are nor able to provide the range of services necessary for survival on the street and long-term recovery off the street. The authors present a grounded theory study of coordination and communication in the provision of service to the urban homeless. They begin by reviewing theoretical perspectives on communication and coordination in interorganizational relationships. They then consider this literature in light of the urban homelessness context.

TI A LOCATION MODEL OF GRAIN PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE

ID RENT
AB The location and welfare relationships between expanded regional grain production and the configuration of a grain transportation system are modeled and analyzed. The region develops by the joint process of a railway extending its branchline network and the farmers expanding grain production. The model provides a mathematical treatment of changes in grain yields and production costs during the region's transition from circular elevator catchment areas and some unused space to hexagonal catchment areas which fill the region. The model connects the production decisions of grain farmers with various features of the system used to collect, transfer, and transport grain and incorporates the interactions between farmers and railways. Simulation of these interactions under various policy regimes and parameter assumptions is possible, but is not reported in the paper.

AB Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) covers programmes on various facets of science and technology through its 40 laboratories. With the new liberalized economic and industrial policies of the Government, CSIR is experiencing a wind of change in its environment. It is pointed out that by the year 2010, CSIR should make our country a global contributor of innovative technology. It would demand commitment, determination, enthusiasm and perseverance from the whole CSIR system. It is argued that CSIR has to take positive actions, including confidence generation, to stimulate partnership with industry. The priority areas mentioned are biotechnology, information technology and food processing. For an effective and quick communication within CSIR, the need for a communication network is outlined. The importance of basic research is highlighted. For realization of the CSIR-Vision 2010, twenty operation goals are suggested.

AB The wish on the part of many governments to decrease the overall level of their expenditure, coupled with the desire to ensure that science is made more relevant to national priorities, is driving many of the changes occurring in science, In Britain 'market forces', including contracting out, market testing and privatization, have been used as mechanisms for changing institutional and ownership arrangements, There have been a number of gains from this approach but there have also been significant costs, The search for relevance has resulted in a number of countries undertaking technology foresight exercises, Most of them follow a similar methodology, though the UK exercise is notable for its size and scope, The trend towards 'outsourcing' of research by many private industries has received less attention than it deserves in terms of national science policy, for it is a fundamental change in the way that industry obtains its science, Unless 'outsourcing' is supported by well-established national and international research and training networks, it could result in problems for some industries in the longer term, Scientific institutions in the public sector will be increasingly dependent on a range of funding sources and a model is presented that provides a framework within which the requirements of the public and private sectors can be accommodated while still maintaining scientific excellence, impartiality and credibility and offering the opportunity to address public-good issues, It is likely in the future that the countries most effectively exploiting their science base will have undertaken successful foresight exercises. They will also have established strong links between research and its application by developing comprehensive and effective national research and training networks that also link into global networks, These will be supported by well-defined institutional arrangements, including intermediate institutes with a specific responsibility for undertaking strategic and applied science underpinned by basic research and for maintaining and strengthening networks.

AB Long-range transport models for acidic sulphur species are being used to develop emission-control strategies to combat environmental acidification in the remote, sensitive regions of Europe. The incorporation of seeder-feeder enhancement into a simple trajectory model for sulphur has markedly improved the representation of wet deposition across Great Britain, as shown by a detailed comparison of the model results with the observations from monitoring networks. An uncertainty analysis reveals that those input parameters which contribute mast to uncertainty in the total sulphur deposition are the sulphur-dioxide emissions, wind speeds and wet-removal coefficients. The total Great Britain dry and wet depositions of sulphur are estimated to be 216 and 241 thousand tonnes per year, respectively, making a total sulphur deposition per year of 457 +/- 110 thousand tonnes, in excellent agreement with the observed quantity of 433 thousand tonnes. The model was used to give an indication of the origin of the deposited sulphur across Great Britain. European land-based sulphur sources contribute 34% of the deposition to Great Britain, with significant dry deposition in south-east England and wet deposition in upland western Britain. UK power stations and oil refineries contribute 46.7% of total deposition, with shipping and natural sulphur sources from algal blooms, a mere 4.6%. Differences in source attribution between this UK-scale. study and those previously published for the long-range transport scale are explored and it is concluded that national-scale models have an important role to play in policy formulation.

AB The MULTIPLUS project which is currently under development at NCE/UFRJ, Brazil, aims at the study of parallel processing problems in MIMD environments.  The project includes the development of a parallel shared-memory architecture and a UNIX[+]-like operating system called MULPLIX.  The MULTIPLUS architecture uses an inverted n-cube multistage network to interconnect clusters of processing nodes designed around a double-bus system.  As a consequence, the architecture is partitionable and modular.  It can easily and efficiently support configurations ranging from workstations to powerful parallel supercomputers with up to 2048 processing nodes.  The MULPLIX operating system provides MULTIPLUS with an efficient computing environment for parallel scientific applications.  MULPLIX uses the concept of thread, implements busy-waiting synchronization primitives very efficiently and carefully considers data locality and scientific processing requirements in the policies adopted for memory management and thread scheduling.

AB This article summarizes many of the sources of stress that often accompany environmental threats, examines both individual and collective strategies for coping with environmental threats and the efficacy of these strategies, and discusses some of the problems with measuring coping strategies and with gauging their success. It describes collective coping strategies within the framework of social and institutional networks, and it considers why grass-roots citizen groups are often formed as a coping strategy and what needs these organizations seem to fulfill. It presents some empirical research on individual and collective coping strategies derived from an investigation that examined residents' coping strategies in response to living near a large hazardous waste landfill. Finally, it addresses some of the social and policy implications of the ways that people cope with environmental hazards.

TI THE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH REROUTING HIGHWAY SHIPMENTS OF HAZARDOUS
   MATERIALS TO MINIMIZE RISK
SO RISK ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; TRANSPORTATION; HIGHWAY; TRADEOFFS
AB Recent legislative and regulatory activities at the federal level have focused attention on the highway routing of hazardous materials. The question is whether routes that minimize the risk of release accidents (i.e., the expected number of persons impacted by releases of hazardous materials) should be used in lieu of the routes that have the lowest operating costs. This policy issue is addressed for interstate shipments by using a national network model to determine the practical route and minimum risk route between each of 100 different origin-destination pairs (state capitals). The resulting cost-risk tradeoffs are then used to estimate the average cost of rerouting per fatality averted, the value of which turns out to be within the range of values for a number of familiar existing regulations.

TI On form versus function: Will the new urbanism reduce traffic, or
   increase it?
SO JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY
AB A major attraction of the popular and influential planning movements known as the new urbanism, transit-oriented development, and neotraditional planning are their presumed transportation benefits. Though the architects and planners promoting these ideas are usually careful to emphasize the many ingredients necessary to obtain desired results-straightening of streets to open the local network, ''calming'' of traffic, better integration of land uses and densities, and so on--a growing literature and number of plans feature virtually any combination of these elements as axiomatic improvements.
   The potential problem is that the traffic impacts of the new plans are generally indeterminate, and it is unclear whether designers understand the reasons well enough to avoid unintended results. This paper proposes a simple behavioral model to identify and assess the tradeoffs these ideas impose on transportation and subdivision planners.

TI Inert wastes - A live issue
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper demonstrates why one county council in the UK has adopted a very proactive position towards inert waste and its reuse and recycling, and how that council is attempting to increase the use of this material. It describes how Babtie has worked with Berkshire County Council and gives an outline of Berkshire and the County's responsibilities. The environmental/planning issues affecting minerals and waste in Berkshire and the approach the Council is adopting via policy documents and its role as a corporate body are discussed. The actions of the County Council are described with regard to increasing the reuse and recycling of inert wastes on the road network and the roles of specifications and contractors. The impact of some of the more relevant issues (markets, practical issues, planning, and supply and demand) is assessed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI Multinational enterprises, political economy and institutional theory:
   domestic embeddedness in the context of internationalization
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is rising interest in placing the study of the multinational enterprise (MNE) at the core of political economy scholarship. This article attempts to locate the MNE in its outer institutional environments. MNEs are embedded in networks of relations with a number of important external actors, not only governments. These networks manifest marked differences between nations and regions, with differential implications for production and managerial arrangements within the firm, public policy choices and the constellation of MNE-government relationships. In the distribution of wealth and power, MNEs are situated at the interface of domestic structures in national and regional political economies, and the process of internationalization within global political economic structures. A research agenda for the 1990s should, therefore, incorporate a political economy of the MNE in structures of global competition and cooperation that have institutional underpinnings. This study seeks to address elements of such an agenda by attempting to overcome the highly artificial distinction between the international and domestic branches of political economy, and selectively making use of the international business literature. It is therefore suggestive of a partial approach (among a number of others) to enhance interdisciplinary research in political economy, making no claim to universal theory on the political economy of the MNE.

DE AUTONOMY; DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS; OBJECT REPLICATION; PERFORMANCE
   COMPARISON; REMOTE CACHING
ID SYSTEMS
AB We study the cache performance in a remote caching architecture. The high performance networks in many distributed systems enable a site to access the main memory of other sites in less time than required by local disk access. Remote memory is thus introduced as an additional layer in the memory hierarchy between local memory and disks. Efficient use of remote memory implies that the system caches the ''right'' objects at the ''right'' sites. Unfortunately, this task can be difficult to achieve for two reasons. First, as the size of the system increases, the coordinated decision making needed for optimal decisions becomes more difficult Second, because the participating sites in a remote caching architecture can be autonomous, centralized or socially optimal solutions may not be feasible. In this paper we develop a set of distributed object replication policies that are designed to implement different optimization goals. Each site is responsible for local cache decisions, and modifies cache contents in response to decisions made by other sites. We use the optimal and greedy policies as upper and lower bounds, respectively, for performance in this environment. Critical system parameters are identified, and their effect on system performance studied. Performance of the distributed algorithms is found to be close to optimal, while that of the greedy algorithms is far from optimal.

AB Objective. This study is designed to examine the effects of environment and structure of the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) on performance as measured by patient accrual to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-approved treatment protocols.
   Data Sources/Study Setting. Data and analysis are part of a larger evaluation of the NCI Community Clinical Oncology Program during its second funding cycle, June 1987-May 1990. Data, taken from primary and secondary sources, included a survey of selected informants in CCOPs and research bases, CCOP grant applications, CCOP annual progress reports, and site visits to a subsample of CCOPs (N = 20) and research bases (N = 5). Accrual data were obtained from NCI records.
   Study Design. Analysis involved three complementary sets of factors: the local health care resources environment available to the CCOP, the larger policy environment as reflected by the relationship of the CCOP to selected research bases and the NCI, and the operational structure of the CCOP itself. A hierarchical model examined the separate and cumulative effects of local and policy environment and structure on performance.
   Principal Findings. Other things equal, the primary predictors of treatment accrual were (1) the larger policy environment, as measured by the attendance of nurses at research base meetings; and (2) operational structure, as measured by the number and character of components within participating CCOPs and the number of hours per week worked by data managers. These factors explained 73 percent of the total variance in accrual performance.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest criteria for selecting the types of organizations to participate in the alliance, as well as for establishing guidelines for managing such alliances. A future challenge is to determine the extent to which factors predicting accrual to cancer treatment clinical trials are equally important as predictors of accrual to cancer prevention and control trials.

TI THE EMERGING DIALOG ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
SO SOCIAL PROBLEMS
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB This special issue of Social Problems provides an interdisciplinary look at the relationship of class, ethnicity, gender, and race to community and workplace environmental problems. Drawing upon case studies, interviews, textual analysis, survey research, and household, community, labor force, and policy data, these articles represent a methodologically eclectic approach to the interpretation of environmental issues as problems of justice in a stratified society. While the disparate impact of social problems on minorities, women, and the poor has long been a central concern in sociology, few sociologists have focused their attention on the environment. A growing public awareness of pollution, toxic exposures, and resource limits has produced new social movements with implications for social theory and practice. A dialogue on environmental justice is emerging in community groups and in the network of national and international organizations which support them. This suggests the need for a parallel dialogue within the community of academics.

TI A TAXONOMY FOR THE MATERIALS HANDLING AND TRANSFER ENVIRONMENT
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING
LA English
DT Article
AB Materials handling and transfer (MHT) constitutes the major physical integrative interface in a CIM environment, moving materials through all stages of manufacture, in the same way as the communications and control network forms the major logical integrative interface by moving data between elements of the CIM system. This broad view of MHT is supported by a comprehensive taxonomy, based upon an MHT 'equation': MATERIAL + MOVE + MANUFACTURE + MEANS + MILIEU + MANAGEMENT = METHOD. MATERIAL encompasses the characteristics of the material to be handled; MOVES-the nature of the movement through the shop floor; MANUFACTURE-the features of the underlying production process; MEANS-the properties of the physical resources for MHT; MILIEU-the environment in which MHT takes place; MANAGEMENT-the types of policies affecting MHT; and METHOD-the handling and transfer equipment to be designed or selected. Over 70 aspects of the six main categories are detailed, together with a set of qualitative values for each aspect.

TI Urban bus transportation: (More about) the debate over regulation and
   deregulation
SO DESARROLLO ECONOMICO-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
LA Spanish
DT Article
AB This paper aims to contribute to the discussion about the proposal of deregulation for urban bus transportation; this proposal emerges from wider policies, that aim to suppress or reduce the case for specific regulatory frameworks. First, the main features of deregulated regimes are reviewed. It is argued then that they do not take into account some important characteristics of this industry, mainly the combination of free entrance, non stockability... and indivisibility, and the nonexistence of theoretical algorithms for designing optimal networks. Although it is suggested that a general conclusion is not feasible instability is likely to occur. Next, two deregulation experiences -Santiago de Chile and Great Britain- are described. Instability in fact took place in both cases; but the overall outcomes are not comparable, due to strong differences at the social and institutional levels. Anyway, they do not seem to be positive, especially in the case of Santiago de Chile, where a regulated regime was reinstated.

DT Article
AB The new industrial policy approach of the EC stresses that industrial adjustment has to be supported by the creation of a positive environment for inter-firm cooperation, the promotion of conditions for entrepreneurship and innovation, the full development of innovative opportunities, and the development of human capabilities (art. 130 of the Treaty of Maastricht).  Since the national systems of innovation are still very different throughout Europe, the European Community decided in the late 1980s to reverse the convergence process from top-down to bottom-up, by introducing programmes which attempt to stimulate the creation of networks of innovators.  This approach was clearly influenced by the debate on industrial districts and by the more general debate on innovation diffusion.  It is based on the possibility of favouring aggregations of firms, research institute, universities, framed in their own national contexts, but forced to cooperate in producing innovation.

LA English
DT Article
AB Computer simulation is now used routinely as a decision support tool in many facets of transportation engineering. Simulation models are often used to compare system alternatives, i.e. alternative system designs and/or operating policies. The presence of high variance of the simulation output variables is a critical problem in such comparative analyses because the models must either be run longer or executed several times to achieve reasonably accurate point and interval estimates of the parameters of interest. The high variability in output measures can also lead to concern about the validity of the model when they are used by the practitioners who are not intimately familiar with the stochastic nature of the model processes. This paper describes and illustrates the effectiveness of variance reduction based on the concept of common random numbers (CRN) for the TRAF-NETSIM simulation model.

TI A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - KELLOGG,WK
   INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS INITIATIVE
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Creating sustainable options for farming systems in the USA requires addressing both technological and nontechnological barriers. It is necessary to continue research, development, and validation of technologies that enhance agricultural productivity, environmental stewardship, and the quality of rural life. Changes in agricultural practices, however, will come about only when economic, policy, informational, and attitudinal barriers to adoption of these technologies are reduced. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF), through its Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) Initiative, is supporting a cluster of community-based IFS projects. The goals of these projects are: (i) for farmers to adopt more integrated and resource-efficient farming systems that maintain productivity and profitability while protecting the environment and the personal health of farmers and their families, and (ii) to assist farmers and others in rural communities in addressing the barriers associated with adopting more resource-efficient and integrated systems. Each IFS project represents a collaboration among individuals and organizations within a community that share concern for the health of their farming systems in the short- and long-term. All WKKF-funded IFS projects are tied together through leadership development, information networking, and the addressing of public policy options necessary to foster sustainable systems. It is the hope of WKKF that it can assist those with an interest in and commitment to fostering more sustainable agriculture in overcoming the existing barriers and creating an agricultural system that can truly sustain many future generations.

AB In France, bacterial resistance monitoring in animals is based on a national network of local veterinary laboratories organised by CNEVA following two methodologies.
   As part of the epidemiological surveillance of Salmonella, LCHA in Paris has been receiving since 1969 most of the strains isolated from animals (sick and healthy carriers) but also from food, feed and environment. For many years sensivity tests have been carried out on strains collected: animal ones, mainly from cattle and poultry, show multiple antibiotic resistance more frequently than those of food or environment.
   Taking into account of the importance of antibiotic resistance in E. coli and Salmonella isolated from sick calves, LPB in Lyon has set up since 1982 a national system for collecting and analysing antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of main bovine pathogens determined routinely by local veterinary laboratories.
   In order to ensure comparability and coherency of data from different laboratories it was necessary to introduce standard techniques and reference reagents. The major bacterial species being tested concern enteric, respiratory and mammary flora.
   This network is useful to detect new resistances. The resistant strains collected are useful to carry out studies on the mechanism of resistance and the efficacy of new molecules. Results constitute the basis of a real predictive epidemiology necessary to lay down a policy for rational use of antimicrobials in animal breeding and veterinary medicine.

TI THE PRESS AND PUBLIC-ACCESS TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT DEBATE
SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an analysis of some aspects of newspaper coverage of environment and development issues. In particular, Global Warming and the Sudan famine are used as case studies of the features of this coverage. It argues that there are few grounds for adopting the optimistic view, as taken by some researchers, that the press will sustain and deepen its reporting of these issues.
   The analysis uses a computer-based methodology in which a key feature is the use of full-text on-line database of the contents of four newspapers. This paper presents the first steps in applying this methodology to the investigation of press reporting. It shows how the broad quantitative indicators available from this source can illustrate comparative patterns of newspaper coverage over long time periods and a wide range of themes.
   The ultimate purpose of this analysis is to understand the processes which contribute to informing or educating public debate about issues that crucially affect the political and economic future of society. The argument is that the press does educate the public (its readers) but that this process is highly selective, it can contradict espoused editorial policy, and frequently environment and development issues receive less prominence as their political significance increases. The analysis shows therefore that in many cases the coverage given to these issues actually declines even as their significance increases.
   The authors argue that a social solution is required if the press is to be re-established as a public educator in a more positive sense. Methods must be developed for monitoring and influencing the processes by which the press manipulates the climate of opinion whilst nurturing its readership. One approach to this problem is taken by the Education Networks for Environment and Development Project at Sussex University where the results of this type of analysis are used to inform an open network of workers in a variety of professional institutions. Future investigations will look in more detail at this concept.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTER-AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Sixteen countries in South, Central and North America have agreed to establish an Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI). Its main goals are to conduct and promote research within the region on global change processes and their interaction's with human activities, and to serve as an effective interface between science and the governmental policy process. The IAI will be an unbounded structure, consisting of a network of research centers committed to its scientific agenda. In addition, affiliated research institutes will carry out complementary projects, and countries outside the region, intergovernmental bodies and other organizations may become associate members. Efforts will be coordinated with the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP), primarily through liaison with the System for Analysis, Research and Training (START) of those programs. Seven research foci for the IAI have been identified: tropical ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles; impacts of climate change on biodiversity; El Nino-Southern Oscillation and interannual climate variability; ocean-land-atmosphere interactions in the intertropical Americas; comparative studies of oceanic, coastal and estuarine processes in temperate zones; comparative studies of temperate terrestrial ecosystems; and high latitude processes. These themes are currently being developed by an Implementation Committee and workshop meetings.

TI The relevance and use of information and telecommunication networks as
   strategic tools in the transport sector: A Dutch case study
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB New information and telecommunication technologies in the transport sector, often named 'Advanced Transport Telematics' (ATT), play a key role in the new European network economy, as they have the potential to offer new solutions to the emerging transport problems in Europe. However, the successful exploitation of ATT in European transport markets depends on the technology being implemented in a way which meets the distinct needs of the different road user groups in order to achieve social acceptance and thereby political approval. It is therefore vitally important that decision makers (i.e. those influencing the adoption of ATT) have sufficient information on the needs of (commercial) road users and on the way they perceive ATT options in addressing those needs. The ATT market comprises a large number of actors from both the public and the private sector. At the demand side, some major potential market sectors can be identified. In addition to private users, there are intermediate or collective users (e.g., road authorities) and commercial users (e.g., the freight sector). In the latter case ATT may play a strategic role by facing the need of the freight sector to orient itself towards the opportunities offered by the European internal market, which has far-reaching impacts not only on organisations operating in international networks, but also on those operating nationally. The aim of the underlying study is to investigate the potential ATT market among these main user and interest groups, where the range of telematics applications will be restricted to those: applied to inter-urban road transport. The focus will be on collective users (road managers) and commercial users (road freight operators). Surveys and in-depth interviews have been used to gather relevant information on the views, attitudes and expectations of these potential users. This empirical information provides interesting and policy relevant insights into the potential of ATT applications for each of these market segments.

DT Article
AB The rapid expansion of natural gas is mainly explained by its intrinsic benefits together with competitive pricing. In Europe when reserves were discovered they were rapidly sent to the market with a price policy competitive and a co-operarive attitude among companies to create a vast network of transport and distribution of natural gas. The gas pipelines can be distinguished in lines bringing the natural gas to markets from domestic on-offshore fields; lines connecting the various consumption centres and the multinational lines. These ones are 12 200 km long (around 30 000 including the CIS) transporting Russian, Algerian, Dutch and Norwegian gas; European have been progressively, building an international gas transmission network and have completed the interlinking of their internal gas networks: extension of the Norwegian gas pipeline system into continental Europe links between UK and Ireland and the continent; links between east and west Germany, France-Spain; new two lines from Algeria. Due to the supply limitations of traditional exporters the deficit of gas expected in Europe should induce an opening lip of the portfolio of external supply sources: Russia and other CIS countries, the North African countries; the Middle East; the Gulf of Guinea and the Latin America. Natural gas in Middle East accounts for 32 % of the world prov en reserves and for only 6 % of the world marketed production. United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Chiyoda and Eni have carried out a preliminary study of a large structure, the Middle East Gas Loop, that is a system of gas pipelines intended to develop the natural gas production and consumption in those countries and export to Europe and Far East: the project offers the countries a dual vantage, on one hand it would open a domestic and export market, oil the other the creation of the gas pipeline would keep out the M.E. countries from increasing their consumption of crude, with great benefits for their economies.

AB A major focus of national and institutional research policies during the 1990s has been on improving linkages between research activities and purpose of advancing economic and other national objectives. The transfer of scientific knowledge, however, within and research institutions, other innovative organizations is taking place within rapidly changing organizational environments. The emergence of new organizational structures that transcend institutional boundaries, scientific disciplines and the boundaries between basic and applied research are all contributing to as well as responding to changes in the ways science intersects with industrial innovation.
   Recent international evidence suggests that innovative organizations during the next decade will depend more on their ability to maintain quite complex organizational research linkages than on their internal organizational research capabilities. Case studies of the organizational approach adopted by companies and commercial-research agency consortia in China and Australia lead to a discussion of a typology of academic-industry alliances. The 'typology provides insights into different collaborative R&D management strategies associated with different forms of science-industry alliance.

AB Total Catchment Management (TCM) has been implemented in New South Wales to provide a more integrated, participatory approach to natural resource management. This change in direction poses significant challenges for obtaining and integrating environmental information. This paper examines the adequacy of environmental information in terms of both the participatory turn in government policy and the management imperatives of the integrated, catchment-wide approach of TCM. Drawing on empirical studies in the Hunter Valley, it is suggested that current information available for TCM is inadequate and reflects a fragmented approach that is primarily concerned with biophysical phenomena and is generated at inappropriate scales. Furthermore, most information is generated by government agencies, ignoring the substantial contribution that catchment occupiers could make. It is argued that the utilisation of the knowledge and experience of occupiers could provide more integrated catchment perspectives while meeting the participatory goals espoused in TCM.

AB This paper aims at positioning spatial development at the crossroads of the conflicting needs for spatial mobility and spatial sustainability. Such tensions have explicitly been recognized in recent local, national and international policy documents. A reconciliation of such antagonistic driving forces in our modern network economy requires a solid theoretical framework in which the relevant force fields are depicted and in which the uncertainties inherent in any attempt at steering human behavior in space are explicitly recognized. This requires an analytical framework in which relevant scenarios are systematically projected on a model structure describing the above mentioned force field. This paper will try to offer an operational methodology for coping with the above mentioned conflicting issues in planning for sustainable spatial development. Particular attention will be given to the spatial scale of analyzing sustainable development. The methodology will be illustrated by presenting empirical results from a case study undertaken in the western part of the Netherlands, the so called Randstad.

TI SPATIAL COMPETITION IN THE BANKING SYSTEM - LOCALIZATION, CROSS
   SUBSIDIES AND THE REGULATION OF DEPOSIT RATES
SO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE BANKING SECTOR; REGULATION; SPATIAL COMPETITION
ID INSURANCE
AB The paper analyses a spatial competition model of the banking sector. Banks offer two kind of services (deposits and credit) and can either borrow or lend on the money market. We investigate the consequences of the regulation of rates paid on deposits. The main conclusions are as follows. Regulation first increases network size beyond social optimum. In the long run it results in lower equilibrium credit rates because of increased competition. Secondly, regulation generates tied sales contracts, by which banks propose bundles of credit and deposit services. Tied sales, in turn, motivate the introduction of cross-subsidies between the two activities, the rent levied upon regulated deposits financing lower rates in the credit market. Finally it is shown that in a regulated environment, the effectiveness of monetary policy is reduced in the sense that fluctuations of money market rates are less than fully transmitted in credit rates.

TI THE INTERPLAY OF RESEARCH AND INFORMATION IN MOST
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Researchers require specific information for their work. Information needs vary according to the phases of research - the preparatory phase, the design phase and the fieldwork and report phase. Social scientific information is also rapidly becoming a central resource for policymaking. Active information provision is replacing passive information collection and storage; there is a shift from stock to flow management. The increasingly strategic value of information leads to the development of strategic information management.
   Strategic information management is concerned with capacity-building in research and policy-making. Six crucial aspects are discussed: exploitation of existing databases, creation of databases, national and regional networking, development of technical infrastructures, solution of the problem of multilingualism in information and communication, and training of information workers and researchers.
   MOST priority themes and research topics may be considered to be foci in strategic information management. MOST is a recently established UNESCO programme of international social science research on ethnicity and multicultural society, cities as arenas of accelerated social transformations and local impacts of global environmental, technological and economic transformations

AB The authors describe a comprehensive system for public health surveillance for the United States based on a network of data systems ranging from population surveys and physician-based records to electronically linked laboratory and administrative data. They also discuss traditional uses of surveillance data, legal and ethical issues associated with using data from any surveillance system (particularly the tension between individual privacy and the public right to a healthful environment), and factors impeding the development of a comprehensive system. Just as provisional data on notifiable diseases are critical in protecting communities from disease, data from other information systems should be applied to prevention practice with the same urgency. The major barriers to a successful comprehensive, nationwide, integrated public health surveillance and information system are a lack of appreciation for the value of high-quality provisional surveillance data and a weak societal commitment to public health.

DT Article
DE DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING; CLIENT SERVER; OBJECT ORIENTATION; TRADER
AB As defined by the APM(1), a trader provides a 'rendezvous mechanism for dynamic binding of clients to some well-known or published services'. Information becomes more involved and inaccessible between clients and servers when the environment grows into a very large-scale networked community. The functions to manage the dynamics of trading become so sophisticated and complicated compared to the simple client/ server concept that they require some special system module to provide such services to both the clients and servers. Standard trading policy also must be established to enable diverse clients and servers to participate in this general trading facility. This paper discusses the increasing prominence of traders and the different stages of growth of the environment in which the traders perform. It examines various standards related to trading. It provides a practicable technical approach, and suggests an implementable architecture leading to the development of a standard-compliant trader that can perform at various stages as the environment matures.

TI THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM LAND-USE GUIDELINES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT
   STRATEGY FOR BELFAST - LESSONS FOR MEDIUM-SIZED CITIES
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
AB At present, Belfast is served by conventional buses, a limited network of railway lines operated with diesel multiple units and a 'black-taxi' paratransit service, The majority of areas are dependent on buses, and these have suffered from a dramatic decline in passenger numbers in recent decades, Such a scenario of declining public transport is not unique to Belfast and in other cities similar problems have stimulated the examination and implementation of alternative transport technologies.
   This study, undertaken during 1991/2 in conjunction with Queen's University Belfast, addressed (a) the potential of alternative technologies for Belfast based on a review of conditions in other cities
   (b) a review of candidate technologies and the development of systems concepts to meet the long-term transportation needs of the conurbation
   (c) the efficacy of the systems concepts, including their operational, economic and financial performance and implications for the environment and the local economy.
   The team identified potential roles for light rail transit and guided buses under a range of funding scenarios and assumptions about future policies on competition in the industry, The study has been under consideration by the client and government since 1992. In addition to the study recommendations this paper describes the process of developing the proposals, including considerations of the role of various interest groups in the likely response by government.

TI THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The achievement of a deductive understanding of global change is now recognized to be one of the most important and difficult scientific challenges ever posed. The evolving commitments and responsibilities of the European Commission towards the Earth's environment have led to comprehensive actions and plans regarding global change research. One of the priority objectives of the environment policy of the European Union-based on the concept of sustainable development-is to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment. The investigation of identified environmental issues is supported, on a shared-cost basis, at a wide variety of academic and research organizations within EU member states. In addition, there is a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary environmental research within the European Commission's own establishment, the Joint Research Centre, and international cooperation, both within and outside Europe, is actively encouraged. Participation in global change programs is a specific component of the current Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development; plans for the further development of work in this area have been prepared. These proposals include the development of a European Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH), building on the capabilities and facilities of existing institutions, and working closely with international global change research initiatives, such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme (HDP).

TI The Asia Pacific Security Dialogue Agenda: A Russian perspective
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the article an attempt is made to observe several key sets of issues of multilateral dialogue on security in the Asia Pacific with regard to their relation to global changes and the region's specific features, as well as to introduce a Russian approach to some of these issues. The presentation is based on a perception that in order to hold an effective dialogue, global and regional dimensions of the Asia-Pacific security should be seen as mutually correlating rather than contradictiory, with due attention to traditional values and the experience of the region.
   Global changes (the end of the Cold War and bipolarity, transition to multirelevant policy, etc.) has led to general improvement of the situation in the Asia Pacific despite the remaining existence of the conflict potential, The ''traditional'' lack of regional negotiating mechanisms is gradually being replaced by emergency of dialogues anti, other fora and the trend of multipolarity, which makes prospects for ensuring regional security promising. Movement towards a future regime of security and stability is considered to be based mainly on a network of multilateral cooperation, without attempts to introduce pre-decided ''master plans,'' it implies a concept of a cooperation ''for all and by all'' members of regional community, and it makes expedient a comprehensive approach to security including all dimensions-political, military, economic, ecological, etc.
   The Asia Pacific policy of the Russian Federation is described as oriented towards developing normal, hopefully partnership relations with all regional states, providing political conditions for reliable regional security, and acceleration of our own economic development through participation in integrational processes. This policy ''eastward'' is considered as a constant element of global Russian diplomacy, both vital for own prosperity and contributing to international peace.
   One of the major tasks of multilateral efforts towards regional peace is seen as connected with the working out of a ''code of behavior'' on the part of the Asian-Pacific nations. One view related to indication of such principles of regional integration is illustrated by the Russian proposal for a declaration on principles of security and stability in the Asia Pacific.
   Regarding regional CBMs a list of options is introduced incorporating both global experience and local realities, including a Russian proposal for regional crisis prevention center.

AB The present methane emissions in the Netherlands amount to 1190 ktonne per year. It is expected that these emissions will decrease by 20% up to the year 2000 due to environmental policies already in place. However, additional emission reduction may be necessary. In this article, the reduction potential and specific costs of additional methane emission reduction measures are presented. The most cost-effective options are landfill gas recovery and utilisation, increased gas utilisation on offshore natural gas production platforms and large-scale digestion of animal manure. Other, less cost-effective options are composting, fermentation and incineration of wastes otherwise landfilled, replacement of the grey cast-iron network in the natural gas distribution grid, and a doubling of the leak control frequency. It is found that these measures would result in an extra emission reduction of about 310 ktonne CH4/yr, of which about 160 ktonne CH4/yr could be avoided with negative or zero net costs. With respect to the 1990 emissions, this would mean a reduction of about 45% and 30% respectively.

AB EuroGeoSurveys is a new European association constituted in 1995 by the Directors of the 15 national geological surveys of the European Union and includes the Norwegian Geological Survey It has developed from a previous grouping 21 Western European geological surveys (WEGS) but has a closer knit, more executive structure and a new mission to enable it to address European issues of common interest to the surveys. It will provide a permanent network between the surveys and promote the contribution of geoscience to improving the quality of life in the European Union and farther afield EuroGeoSurveys plans to use the huge information resources of the national geological surveys, gathered over an average of 119 years in each country, and the exercise of 6000 specialist staff, to provide focused advice to European Union decision-makers and policy planners on realistic future options for issues involving natural resources, the environment and natural hazards. EuroGeoSurveys plans to propose scenarios for concerted action in these fields by surveys, decision-makers from the European Union institutions, governments and industrial and environmental organisations. A Bureau, opened in Brussels in January 1996, will promote continuous information exchange with these bodies.

TI ORGANIZATION THEORY AND THE MARKET FOR CORPORATE-CONTROL - A DYNAMIC

AB This paper describes how takeovers are accomplished and why they are not readily accommodated by existing organizational theories. We examined the factors that made organizations vulnerable to takeovers during the 1980s, using event-history techniques on time-series data covering all takeover bids for Fortune 500 firms between January 1980 and December 1990. The paper shows that greater organizational slack, age, and having a finance chief executive officer increased the risk of takeover; family control and financial characteristics such as a higher market-to-book ratio lowered the risk; while bank control and intercorporate network ties had no discernable effect. The results indicate an irony: Large corporations that were most successful by the standards of organization theory were most likely to be taken over in the 1980s. We argue that theory about organizations and environments has been premised on an assumption of managerialism that is no longer tenable and that it must adjust to the financial model of the corporation that now dominates economic and policy discourse.

DE ecologic framework; family support; healthy cities
AB The family support movement in the US emerged at about the same time brat the WHO Healthy Cities project was gaining momentum in Europe, and the underlying principles and ecologic frameworks of the two have much in common. However, while many 'Healthy Cities' in Europe have included activities that benefit families, this has not been made a major focus. There seems to be little awareness of experience gained in the US in terms of establishing programs with limited or no government funding, using volunteers, and developing social marketing and advocacy strategies to sustain long term viability Similarly, cities and states in the US are struggling to develop networks of family support programs and they appear to be doing this without the benefit of experience gained in Healthy Cities projects on how to engage political leadership, develop public policies, establish intersectoral councils, fund a coordinator position, mobilize neighborhoods, and evaluate community wide health promotion programs. The purpose of this paper is to examine how these two movements might join forces and learn from each other.

ID PERSPECTIVES; CALIFORNIA; FISHES
AB Ecologically effective ecosystem management will require the development of a robust logic, rationale, and framework for addressing the inherent limitations of scientific understanding. It must incorporate a strategy for avoiding irreversible or large-scale environmental mistakes that arise from social and political forces that tend to promote fragmented, uncritical, short-sighted, inflexible, and overly optimistic assessments of resource status, management capabilities, and the consequences of decisions and policies. Aquatic resources are vulnerable to the effects of human activities catchment-wide, and many of the landscape changes humans routinely induce cause irreversible damage (e.g., some species introductions, extinctions of ecotypes and species) or give rise to cumulative, long-term, large-scale biological and cultural consequences (e.g., accelerated erosion and sedimentation, deforestation, toxic contamination of sediments). In aquatic ecosystems, biotic impoverishment and environmental disruption caused by past management and natural events profoundly constrain the ability of future management to maintain biodiversity and restore historical ecosystem functions and values. To provide for rational, adaptive progress in ecosystem management and to reduce the risk of irreversible and unanticipated consequences, managers and scientists must identify catchments and aquatic networks where ecological integrity has been least damaged by prior management, and jointly develop means to ensure their protection as reservoirs of natural biodiversity, keystones for regional restoration, management models, monitoring benchmarks, and resources for ecological research.

TI BARRIERS TO CONTESTABILITY IN THE DEREGULATED EUROPEAN AVIATION MARKET
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID AIRLINE INDUSTRY
AB The deregulation of aviation in the United States and intercity bus transport in the United Kingdom initially resulted in substantial fare reductions associated with new market entry.  Many new market entrants subsequently left the market and fares increased.  International aviation in Europe has been operated by national airlines with price collusion and capacity sharing and a ban on new entrants.  The normal economy fares charged on air services within Europe are the highest in the world.  Therefore, there is significant scope for fare reductions when the European Community (EC) internal market comes into operation in 1993.  Deregulation of market access will, however, leave unaddressed other barriers to contestability in the deregulated European aviation market.  The structural barriers to contestability include hub airport dominance by the incumbent airlines, ground handling monopolies, and computer reservation system (CRS) bias.  The paper proposes measures to ensure access to major airports for new entrant airlines on equal terms with incumbent airlines and the deregulation of the market for airport ground handling.  The EC code of conduct for the neutral operation of CRS for incumbent and new entrant carriers is an important precedent.  The strategic obstacles to contestability in a deregulated European airline industry are anticompetitive mergers and predatory pricing.  In recent years national airlines have acquired several independent airlines in important European markets.  It is recommended that such takeovers be prohibited because of their anticompetitive implications in the absence of competition between national airlines.  The large networks of national airlines allow them to pursue policies of geographical price discrimination with reduced fares on contested routes and higher fares on uncontested routes.  Price surveillance is recommended to explain fare differences between contested and uncontested routes.  It is recommended that the EC competition policy exemption for price consultations between airlines be ended.  Without measures to tackle the structural and strategic obstacles to competition in European aviation, its liberalization may have no impact on the present high-cost system.

ID ORINOCO RIVER; LAKE-VALENCIA; CHEMISTRY; FLOODPLAIN
AB The objective of the present research is to present a global view of Venezuelan limnology.  In contrast with the great variety of lacustrine and fluvial resources, the number of theoretical and practical limnological studies are few.  This is the result, first of all, of a lack of clear policies regarding the use and conservation of natural resources (fisheries and hydroelectric) and on the other hand, to the scarcity of human resources capable of conducting studies, comprehend and manage the functioning of our continental ecosystems.
   According to the physiogeographic variety of Venezuela, in each of the different regions of the country there are great water masses that include:  rivers, Andean and coastal lagoons, wetland, lakes and reservoirs.  However, most of our aquatic ecosystems are rivers grouped into two watersheds:  Atlantic Ocean, covering 82% of the national territory, to which the Orinoco River and its tributaries belong, and the Caribbean Sea watershed integrated by all the rivers draining into this sea.
   We have summarized the limnological knowledge existent up to date, according to 6 categories:  coastal lagoons, flooding systems (Orinoco watershed), mountain rivers (orituco River watershed), lakes (Valencia Lake), the complex fluvial and ecological network of the Maracaibo Lake (continental waters, lake, estuarine region, reservoirs and rivers) and reservoirs.
   The Orinoco watershed is the dominant hydrographic unit of Venezuela due to its area as well as its discharge.  Because of its mean annual discharge, the Orinoco occupies the third place in the world scale after the Amazon and Zaire. Additionally, the flooding area of the Orinoco (97,000 km2) constitutes one of the main wetlands of the neotropics.  In this system the physical as well as the biological processes, are dependent upon the annual hydrological cycle.  This annual pulse of inundation determines in minor or major degree all the ecoogical processes that take place in the system.  Therefore, any alteration of the hydrological regime will result in drastic changes not only ecologically but socially and economically.
   The Orituco River is an example of a mountain river whose peculiarities could be used to characterize these numerous types of ecosystems that exist in the country.  This small river (7,580 km2) has a high concentration of nitrate and cations as well as a high transport of inorganic material (73%).  The density of invertebrates is not as high as expected for a tropical river; however the secondary production is higher than that reported for some temperate systems.
   The Valencia Lake is our main lentic system which today is highly contaminated as is shown by the elevated concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus (10.3 and 3.3 g/m2/year respectively) and the low diversity of phyto and zooplankton.  There are plans to recover the ecosystem on the basis of treatment plants for sewage and industrial wastes.
   The Maracaibo Lake, as is indicated by its subdivision into 8 ecological regions, is a complex system whose study has been directed to answer questions which arise from the fisheries or petroleum industry.  However, in the last years an effort has been made to study the lake as an integral unit.  To this goal there have been investigations conducted on areas whose future use will be mining as well as the reservoirs of the region.
   The reservoirs in Venezuela are an important part of the aquatic resources (700,000 ha).  However, the limnological knowledge of this system is limited mainly due to the discontinuity and isolated effort that characterizes it.  However, as an exception we could mention the studies conducted on the Lagartijo (Miranda State) and Socuy (Zulia State). Our knowledge of reservoir should be different soon when the data on the integrative study on the Guri reservoir are available.
   The Mantecal Modules are a special case of reservoir.  The studies conducted in this ecosystem indicated that the waters are acidic, poor in nutrients and that the high.  The density and diversity of phyto and zooplankton is high.
   Finally, this general view of the limnology in Venezuela clearly indicated that the Venezuelan State should consider studies on aquatic ecosystems with emphasis on the capacitation of human resources.

ID FRAGMENTATION; EXTINCTION
AB The Netherlands, fragmentation of (semi)natural ecosystems is regarded as a major nature conservation problem, The current Dutch Nature Conservation Policy Plan proposes a spatial network consisting of existing nature reserves, nature redevelopment areas and corridor zones, One of the objectives is to stop the assumed decline of biodiversity due to fragmentation, In this contribution we show that breeding birds are affected by the spatial distribution of their habitat, We also show how problems due to fragmentation can be solved by integrating landscape ecological research data into planning procedures, Fragmented bird populations show metapopulation characteristics, dependent on the degree of fragmentation. This can be concluded from pattern studies, in which presence or absence patterns are correlated with spatial characteristics. Metapopulation dynamics were used, and the frequency of local extinction and of recolonization were related to size of habitat patches and spatial position in the landscape, The conclusion is that, depending on the spatial scale, landscape fragmentation is a threat to birds, On the basis of empirical data, statistical and metapopulation models are being developed to be used to evaluate spatial planning scenarios and to support decision making about which scenario is closest to the planning aims.

TI COMPUTERIZING GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE CARE AND PATIENT-OUTCOMES - THE
   EXAMPLE OF HEART-FAILURE
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Note
ID HEALTH-CARE
AB Increasing amounts of medical knowledge, clinical data, and patient expectations have created a fertile environment for developing and using clinical practice guidelines. Electronic medical records have provided an opportunity to invoke guidelines during the everyday practice of clinical medicine to improve health care quality and control costs. In this paper, efforts to incorporate complex guidelines [those for heart failure from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR)] into a network of physicians' interactive microcomputer workstations are reported. The task proved difficult because the guidelines often lack explicit definitions (e.g., for symptom severity and adverse events) that are necessary to navigate the AHCPR algorithm. They also focus more on errors of omission (not doing the right thing) than on errors of commission (doing the wrong thing) and do not account for comorbid conditions, concurrent drug therapy, or the timing of most interventions and follow-up. As they stand, the heart failure guidelines give good general guidance to individual practitioners, but cannot be used to assess quality of care without extensive ''translation'' into the local environment. Specific recommendations are made so that future guidelines will prove useful to a wide range of prospective users.

ID ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS
AB The electric utilities of North America have become ever more interconnected via transmission facilities, largely to insure reliability.  Current policy discussions regarding transmission include calls for improved access, increased capacity, and deregulation to facilitate trade in electric power.  From an environmental perspective, two issues have been notably absent in much of the debate:  (1) a recognition of the full range of environmental impacts related to electricity transmission; and (2) the potential for end-use efficiency to address the reliability and economy requirements that motivate attention to transmission.  This paper broaches these issues, starting with an elaboration of the environmental impacts, which range from global and regional effects to local concerns, including the potential health risks associated with electric and magnetic fields.  We emphasize that transmission planning should occur as part of an integrated planning process, in which the environmental and social costs of various options are fully considered.  We discuss the potential for end-use efficiency to lessen environmental impacts of both transmission and generation.  We conclude that there is a need to ensure that environmental externalities and demand-side alternatives are adequately considered when transmission network expansions are proposed.

AB In Germany, existing experiences with ''sheltered housing'' are not sufficient in order to precisely define the role of this new type of housing the aged within the overall network of care for the elderly.  First, this article provides an overview of how different the needs for help in old age can be, and which types of supportive environments and services fit to different situations.  In this context the potential and the limits of the ''sheltered home'' concept are described.  Second, based on some policy considerations, a program of seven design directives for the planning of sheltered homes is proposed that integrates selected theoretical approaches of environmental psychology and geropsychology.  As an example for the implementation of some of the design directives, the floor-plan of a recent project is described.  Finally, the resistance of architects to a design, which is also based on psychological considerations is discussed.  It is argued that the architects' philosophy about the fit between architecture and users' needs has a certain similarity to the ''complementary-similarity-model,'' developed by Carp and Carp (1984).

AB Agroforesty plots offer the opportunity to combine annual agricultural production and long-term wood capitalization. The fallow scheme now in operation in Europe intends to reduce the surplus of agricultural products. Agroforestry management could be a valuable alternative to fallow or to forestry plantations on agricultural land.
   Agroforestry is attractive to agricultural landowners in Mediterranean France, as agroforestry stands are less costly than forestry plantations, are less prone to fire hazards, provide agricultural returns from intercropping during the first twenty years and have many environmental benefits.
   An experimental network of on-farm agroforestry plots has been set up since 1988 in the Mediterranean part of France. These plots include grazed paddocks (silvopastoral systems) and ungrazed fields (silvoarable systems). They gained support both from landowners and tenants: the former expect a high value treestock, while the latter have a free use of the space between plantation lines. Plantations have been designed to allow easy mechanical intercropping. First results from two experimental sites are discussed. The growth of the trees in the agroforestry plots is much higher than in the control forestry plots.

   Prisoner's Dilemma; recurrent neural network; exploration
ID ELEMENTS
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is based on the idea that the tendency to produce an action should be strengthened (reinforced) if it produces favorable results, and weakened if it produces unfavorable results. Q-learning is a recent RL algorithm that does not need a model of its environment and can be used on-line. Therefore, it is well suited for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent. Most RL research has been confined to single-agent settings or to multiagent settings where the agents have totally positively correlated payoffs (team problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither totally positively nor totally negatively correlated. RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain. This paper investigates the ability of a variety of Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is the fixed strategy Tit-For-Tat, while in others it is another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play optimally against Tit-For-Tat. Playing against another learner was more difficult because the adaptation of the other learner created a non-stationary environment, and because the other learner was not endowed with any a priori knowledge about the IPD game such as a policy designed to encourage cooperation. The learners that were studied varied along three dimensions: the length of history they received as context, the type of memory they employed (lookup tab;les based on restricted history windows or recurrent neural networks that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties when playing against other learners, agents with longer history windows, lookup table memories, and longer exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.

AB The performance of a sample of French urban transit companies is evaluated using a broad selection of nonparametric reference technologies for two specifications of the production process. In particular, the variable returns to scale Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models with either strong or weak disposability in both inputs and outputs, and the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) are applied. An extensive comparison of the resulting radial output efficiency measures yields the following major methodological conclusions. First, the location of the efficiency distributions differs substantially depending on the methodology and especially on the output specification considered. The tatter differences vanish if the impact of outliers is eliminated. Second, convexity has a stronger influence on the efficient-inefficient dichotomy than allowing for congestion by means of a weakly disposable DEA model. For policy purposes, these efficiency distributions are explained using a Tobit model. The findings corroborate results reported elsewhere: the relevance of ownership, the use of risk-sharing incentives in contracting, the harmful impact of subsidies, etc. Furthermore, the network structure seems to account for some differences in performance. Finally, a novelty in the urban transit context is the indirect monitoring effect of the French earmarked transportation tax. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI EUROPEAN FEATURES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - A CONTRIBUTION TO THE
   DIALOG
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE; DIVERSIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY
AB Within the framework of agricultural policy-making, the world-wide demands for sustainable development in general are related to the sustainable development of rural areas in particular. According to the definitions of sustainability, four fundamental aspects are considered: (1) food security; (2) employment and income generation; (3) environmental and natural resource conservation; (4) people's participation and empowerment. Different priorities may be set in the implementation of these aspects, expressing different attitudes toward nature, society and the ethical decisions involved. In line with these differences, different strategies for agricultural development are favoured, each with specific consequences for rural development. In this paper, we consider some of the basic features of the above-mentioned problems, focusing on technical aspects but touching upon some underlying social and ethical issues as well. We compare basic requirements of sustainable development with some features of recent strategies, such as integrated agriculture (integrated pest management and integrated plant nutrition systems) and low external input sustainable agriculture (LEISA). Special attention is given to the principles underlying autonomous ecosystem management (AEM), as applied in organic types of agriculture (OA). By aiming for the multi-purpose efficiency of the agro-ecosystem and its subsystems, OA complies with the requirements for a sustainable use of natural resources. Its impact on the environment, nature and landscape meet the requirements of European Community (EC) and national policies. Its economic performance is remarkably similar to that of comparable conventional farms. Yields tend to be somewhat lower than those of high external input agriculture (HEIA), but enough to meet the EC's efforts to diminish overproduction, and OA seems to meet society's need for sufficient good-quality food. Also, higher labour demands in organic agriculture, labour diversification and upgrading at the farm, and the social networks between farmers and consumers make a significant contribution to sustainable social development. This presentation of various development perspectives can widen the options for choices. Far from offering a blueprint or turnkey solution, these considerations are meant as a contribution to a challenging dialogue on agriculture's role in sustainable rural development.

DE SPECIMEN BANK; GREAT LAKES
AB A study to examine the feasibility of establishing a Regional Specimen Bank in the Great Lakes area of the United States and Canada has recently been initiated by the Michigan Audubon Society. There are several existing formal and informal specimen banking facilities active in the region but their combined adequacy has not been evaluated. This feasibility study will establish the need and use of a regional bank and the institution(s) necessary to satisfy this need will be recommended. The study will address the scope required to meet present and future needs including the types of specimens to be represented in the bank, geographic coverage and protocols for collection, shipping, processing, analysis and storage. A management policy of the bank will be developed encompassing business operation, costs, governing structure and personnel requirements. The legal requirements of the bank will be determined with regards to the acquisition of samples, transport across national boundaries, access to specimens and information, and liability during operation. An effective information dissemination network will be recommended that is compatible with national and international partners, will facilitate technology and information transfer and support the quality and status of the bank. Determination of secure, long-term funding sources will be one of the key elements to ensuring a safe repository. This feasibility study is funded by the Great Lakes Protection Fund.

AB A new two-dimensional finite layer formulation that allows consideration of both vertical and horizontal contaminant migration in systems that may consist of both fractured and unfractured layers is described.  Consideration is given to contaminant migration from typical municipal and nonhazardous waste disposal sites.  The migration of concentrated dense nonaqueous phase contaminant, which involves additional transport mechanisms, is not considered in this paper.  The use of the theory is illustrated with respect to a number of hypothetical cases.  The results indicate that even relatively widely spaced small fractures can have a significant effect on potentiall impact on groundwater quality in an underlying aquifer.  It is also shown that when dealing with relatively impermeable tills, impact on an underlying aquifer may not occur until after the landfill leachate is at a low strength; however, the impact may be quite significant and may last for hundreds of years.  Consideration is given to the implication of regulatory policies that specify the maximum impact that can ever be permitted and those that simply specify that there be no impact for a specified (e.g., 100 year) period.  It is shown that landfills that meet the requirements of no impact within the first 100 years may subsequently have a significant (unacceptable) impact on groundwater quality.

TI One and two year outcomes for adults with learning disabilities
   discharged to the community
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background. Long-stay patients with learning disabilities (n=214) were assessed in hospital and 12 and 24 months after discharge in order to examine the effects of relocation.
   Method. Each resident acted as his/her own control in a prospective repeated-measures design. Skills and behavioural problems were assessed by keyworkers. Self-perceived quality of life was obtained during interviews with researchers who also completed an environmental checklist of the residents' accommodation.
   Results. There was little or no change in people's low pre-discharge skill levels. Certain aspects of problem behaviour improved after 12 months, although socially unacceptable behaviour increased slightly. People were less depressed (P less than or equal to 0.01) 12 months after discharge (n=119) and were more satisfied (P less than or equal to 0.05) with their new 'homes' (n=108). There were few changes in the pattern of a activities or the social networks of people 12 months later. Little or no further change in outcomes was reported 24 months after discharge.
   Conclusions. The implementation of the deinstitutionalisation policy in Northern Ireland has been limited by the predominance of residential and nursing homes and the lack of 'ordinary' accommodation. There is a need for purchasers and providers to give more attention to ways in which the principles of normalisation could be incorporated in the process of contracting and delivering services.

TI THE DIFFUSION AND SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATION
   TECHNOLOGIES IN THE ITALIAN REGION OF CAMPANIA
SO TECHNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The diffusion and spatial distribution of technological innovation are nowadays widely analyzed by many researchers. Because of high pervasiveness and strong linkages with the socioeconomic environment and the mobility system, one of the main tasks deals with the analysis of new telecommunication technologies. The recent improvements in the field add an alternative, feasible, perspective to physical movement (substitution and complementary effects), so contributing to the growth or decline of congested and peripheral areas in developed countries. Our purpose is that of adding a spatial perspective to the current theory and practice of forecasting analysis, considering the decentralization opportunities offered by telematic factors.
   In this paper, we therefore analyze the telecommunication market in the Campania region of Italy, compare its growth rate to the overall trend, and focus on the subregional components. Furthermore, at a deeper level of detail, we study the congested and overcrowded metropolitan area of Naples, where urban planners and policy makers hoped that the mainspring of new technologies could help in reducing congested networks and air pollution emissions. The results of our analysis show, on the contrary, that the opportunity for decentralization has not been taken up in practice, and that the introduction of new telematic factors is still far from the levels measured in the most developed areas of the Country (Milan, Rome, etc.).

   PROJECT MANAGEMENT; FEEDBACK; IMPACT OF CHANGE; PRISM
AB A software development environment supports a complex network of items of at least the following major types:  people, policies, laws, resources, processes, and results.  For various predictable and unpredictable reasons, such items may need to be changed on an on-going basis.  This problem of change, however, has not as yet been surmountable, and is therefore currently of fundamental importance in software environment research.  In an attempt to overcome this problem, we have designed in the Prism project a model of changes and its supporting two change-related environment infrastructures with the following key or unique features:  (i) separation of changes to the described items from the changes to the environmental facilities encapsulating these items; (ii) a facility, called the Dependency Structure, for describing various items and their interdependencies, and for identifying the items affected by a given change; (iii) a facility, called the Change Structure, for classifying, recording, and analyzing change-related data, and for making qualitative judgments of the consequences of a change; (iv) identification of the many distinct properties of a change; and (v) a built-in mechanism for providing feedback.  This paper describes our approach to the problem of change and gives a rationale for the design of the model of changes as well as that of the two change-related environment infrastructures.

AB Arid and semi-arid lands cover 70% of Australia, and bear a legacy of degradation and species loss from past policies and management. Pastoralism, the most extensive industry, as well as other land users and the community at large, are seeking sustainable use of these lands in the future. This paper outlines a new approach to the problem of integrating conservation and production.
   We clarify the distinction between the individual manager's enterprise goal of sustainable land use, and the community's goal of regional conservation of biodiversity through ecologically sustainable land management. From an understanding of the functioning of productive (relatively fertile and moist) and unproductive (infertile and arid) parts of the landscape, we then develop a conceptual framework for land use within areas that have priority for conservation management. We describe a system of management which integrates national parks with off-reserve protection. Landscape elements for management are defined to include national parks, excised management units, restricted use units and a sustainably managed majority. The financial resources that society would need to dedicate to the stewardship of the land are made transparent by a methodology for assessing the relative importance of different areas. In areas which are marginally productive for livestock, we suggest that unambiguous financial assistance could enable managers to remain on the land; they would assist with the management of feral animals, weeds, fire and local reserves, in exchange for the certainty that any residual use of the land was sustainable. We put priorities on outstanding research issues.
   These arrangements would enhance the process by which all users of arid Australia-whether pastoralists, tourist operators, Aboriginal people or park managers-come to act as land stewards, obtaining services from the land in an ecologically sustainable manner. We discuss the cultural and political changes that are needed to permit this scheme to evolve from its present conceptual state to an operational system, emphasizing the fact that the informed involvement of current land managers will be crucial.

AB Knowledge about the nature of life as well as about the nature of human reality are essential to the study and practice of psychology and psychiatry. Body, mind, thought, and deed are inextricably entangled in a complex network of interconnections which, due to our human limitations, can never be fully understood (Capra, 1988; Chopra, 1989; Frankl, 1969; Gut, 1989; Hughes, 1974). In the development of psychology, much energy has been spent seeking scientifically acceptable concepts, laws, and measurements which subscribe to the Cartesian image of the human being as a clockwork mechanism (Capra, 1988; von Bertalanffy, 1968). To accommodate this mechanistic image, psychological theorists have largely borrowed and adapted concepts from physics, physiology, and mathematics, with little consensus reached about the validity of their actions. The tendency to emulate ''hard'' science has contributed to the failure of psychological theory and practice to relate comprehensively to the broad issues and problems of human existence (Jordaan & Jordaan, 1984; White, 1993a). The process-based systems view, which has its origins in Heraclitus of Ephesus (Kahn, 1981; Kirk, Raven, & Schofield, 1983; Wheelwright, 1959), is a radical reversal of the mechanistic view and represents the human being as an ''active personality system,'' in which individual uniqueness and creative potential are valued. The systems view of humanity raises issues largely ignored by a scientific psychological view-such as aspects of creativity, self awareness, unpredictability, multivariable interaction, dynamic organization, self-maintenance, directiveness, etc. Process-based systems thinking does not disregard structural aspects of systems but regards them as the conceptual or material coherence of processes. It is a perspective in which process is ''foregrounded'' relative to structure. The relationship of process to structure suggests a union of opposites (Sabelli, 1991a,b) in which both empirical and interpretive outlooks are compatible (Messer, 1990), reflecting a healthy regard for methodological and theoretical diversity. Process-based systems thinking promotes a shift from structure-based rigidity to a position which presents new challenges and invites a fresh look at old issues in this postmodern (Gergen, 1992; Kvale, 1992) era of psychology. The premises of process-based systems thinking singled out for discussion in this article are: the process nature of life (and psychology), the approximate nature of systems, dynamic organization, the union of opposites, teleos, governance, and emergence in systems.

AB This paper reviews the literature linking cesarean section with maternal, paternal and infant/child/familial psychosocial impact. Cesarean section is discussed as both major surgery, with concomitant physical and psychosocial ramifications, and as an increasingly and routinely utilized method of birthing. Also considered are factors associated with the current high cesarean birthrate, as well as socio-cultural based factors contributing to varying parental conceptualizations and expectations of birthing. Empirical research published during the past 14 years associates cesarean section with adverse maternal and paternal psychosocial outcome and with possible negative consequences for the infant/child. Weaknesses/flaws of psychosocial impact studies are discussed, including timing and location of data collection, sample bias, and the difficulties of analyzing vast arrays of complex variables. Enumeration of both physical/environmental variables and psychosocial/cultural variables of maternal psychosocial impact are included. A number of these variables form a profile of a woman at relatively high risk of adverse psychosocial outcome. This profile is useful in identification of approaches and strategies for the prevention of adverse psychosocial outcome as well as in the identification of women who might benefit from focused perinatal psychotherapeutic services. The importance of psychotherapeutic services for cesarean families, including local, national and international cesarean support networks, is discussed. Emphasis is given to the importance of increased awareness of psychosocial issues and of current research on the part of medical care providers and health policy experts.

TI PATIENTS PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR QUALITY-OF-LIFE 11 YEARS AFTER DISCHARGE
   FROM A STATE-HOSPITAL
SO HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID MENTAL-PATIENTS; COMMUNITY
AB Objective:  Fifty-three state hospital patients discharged to group homes in the community in 197879 were followed up at three and 11 years to assess their quality of life and several other dimensions of their community experience. Methods: A structured interview was used to obtain data on patients' perceptions of and degree of satisfaction with aspects of their lives one month before hospital discharge and at three and 11 years after. Group home staff rated patients' functioning at follow-up. Data on rehospitalizations over the 11-year period were collected. Results: At 11-year follow-up, 30 of the surviving 40 patients were living in noninstitutional settings: nine in independent or semi-independent settings and 21 in group homes. The 30 patients perceived that their quality of life outside the hospital had improved in several ways, including the extent of their social networks, the quality of their living environment, and their capacity to meet basic needs. When data were averaged over the 11 years and corrected for the shorter time in the study of subjects who died, patients spent only 2.6 percent of the follow-up period in the hospital. Only one patient at 11 years wanted to return to the hospital. Conclusions: The finding that even the small minority of patients who required multiple rehospitalizations preferred community life may have important clinical and policy implications for setting the threshold of hospital discharge.

DT Article
AB In 1994 the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study of emerging infectious disease threats (a brief excerpt from which appeared in PDR 20, no. 3, September 1994). That study, perhaps together with the publicity generated by several recent books and films, led to the setting up of an interagency working group on the subject within the Clinton administration, under the aegis of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The NSTC is a cabinet-level body that coordinates federal government science and technology policies. Some 17 departments and agencies were represented in the working group, including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, State, and Defense, and the National Security Council. The group's report, Infectious Disease-A Global Health Threat, was published in September 1995.
   The report is largely concerned with prospective US actions toward strengthening global capacities for infectious disease surveillance, improving medical responses to disease emergencies, and meeting biomedical and epidemiological research needs. Recommendations call for establishing or upgrading disease surveillance and response networks in major world regions in cooperation with the World Health Organization and its collaborating centers, and far rebuilding the US public health infrastructure, Section I of the report, reproduced below, discusses the origins and scope of the problem, and provides a tabulation of recently identified pathogens. (Population growth is identified as a contributing factor in the resurgence of infectious disease. However, the supporting claim, ''by some estimates,'' that more than half the world's population is tinder age IS is in error. UN data indicate that the peak was 38 percent, in 1965; by 1995 it had dropped to 31.5 percent. The context suggests that the intended reference may have been to the proportion urban-about 48 percent in 1995.)
   In line with the current budget-cutting climate in the United States, the report ends with a caveat from the office of Management and Budget stating that the working group's recommendations ''will have to compete for resources against many other high priority Federal programs'' in ''a very challenging budget environment.''

AB The spatial dimension of man-environment interactions in old age is analyzed within urban, suburban, and rural residential environments of the German Rhein-Main-Agglomeration. By comparing the three levels of organization, utilization, and interpretation, housing conditions as well is geographical distribution and redistribution (migrations) our outside-home-activities and environmental perception show a fundamental influence on the everyday lives of the 750 elderly who were interviewed. The majority of the target population and, especially, the rural elderly is characterized by traditional patterns of spatial organization and distribution, mobility, regional attachment, and a concern about preserving the stability of their current residential environment from changes. The suburban and urban seniors, however, exhibit a greater amount of locational flexibility and utility-oriented behavior patterns. These spatial variations are induced by specific regional values ind intensity of local and regional identification. They might be interpreted as different stages in the process of modernization within postindustrial societies.
   Reflecting, however, the paradigms of planning for the elderly, these different patterns are not systematically considered to the necessary and sufficient extent. Instead of promoting regional or local networks that are favored by senior citizens, agencies usually prefer comprehensive approaches on a macrolevel. First steps to improve this situation and to combine life- and system-world demands have been taken by the federal government, which implemented a neighborhood-related research program on housing for the elderly. As a result of this, further research on environmental aspects on aging should pay more methodological attention to the hitherto neglected regional and local level, and also for the transfer of its findings into planning policy.

TI NEGLECT OF BIOLOGICAL RICHES - THE ECONOMICS OF NATURE TOURISM IN NEPAL
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE ECONOMICS; ECOTOURISM; NEPAL; PROTECTED AREAS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT;
   TOURISM
AB Nepal's spectacular parks and reserves have attracted dramatically increasing numbers of foreign visitors. It might be expected that these protected areas would be nurtured as valuable and irreplaceable economic assets. However they are becoming seriously degraded and the financial resources provided for their management have been inadequate. This paper explores why - starting with the hypothesis that so little of the economic value of protected area tourism in Nepal is captured through fees and other charges assessed on foreign visitors that the protected areas are perceived as being of inconsequential value. It is conservatively estimated that $27 million of tourists' total expenditure in Nepal were attributable to the protected area network in 1988, when the costs of managing the parks were less than $5 million but direct fees collected from tourists visiting the protected areas amounted to less than $1 million. These figures suggest the parks are a good investment. But it could also be argued that the costs of park management were more than five times the revenues collected by the government from park tourists. Policy measures are identified which could help Nepal increase the economic as well as environmental benefits from nature tourism.
   Case studies of Nepal's most-visited protected areas emphasize that the lack of funds for protected area management is not the only constraint on effective management. Some important economic and institutional interests have yet to be effectively reconciled with conservation in the protected areas. Most problematic are local people's economic aspirations and the operating practices of the principal government agencies involved - the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and the Ministry of Tourism. Fortunately there have recently been some encouraging signs of change within both of these agencies.

AB The new trends in agricultural policy in Western Europe conduct to new management problems in maintaining and utilizing biological resources. In the South-Western France, the evolution of agricultural practices occurs in two opposite ways. On one hand, the intensification of agriculture leads to simplify the landscape by hedgerows removal, grasslands ploughing and drainage for corn cultivation. On the other hand, the decreasing numbers of cattle and sheep conduct the less fertile parts of the territory to evolve into fallow, These two processes are closely linked on a same territory and important interactions exist between intensive agricultural areas and semi-natural communities. To understand the importance of these interactions and their role in ecological stability of landscapes, we use passerine bird communities as an ecological indicator.
   We modelized the relationships between birds and landscape structure from 256 releves. Each releve includes a bird count point of 20 mn and a description of the landscape feature on the surrounding 6.25 ha. An ordination of the releves along the main ecological gradients was realized using Correspondence Analysis. Then, these ordinations where related to the landscape structure with Stepwise and Multiple Regression Analysis. The rate of woody area, the hedgerow network complexity and the rate of fallow land are the main ecological gradients. We have used this model to measure the importance of the changes induced on landscape by a range of management practices differing in intensity. To achieve this aim we compare the displacement of 116 releves along the ecological gradients between 1983 and 1988. The changes occurring both in bird composition and landscape structure reveal the ecological impacts of the different management practices (hedgerow removal, drainage, ploughing, decreasing grazing pressure). We examine the behaviour of ecological diversity of landscape units differing in structure and use.

AB Changes in the pattern of growth over a 20-year period are described for a combined rural and semi-urban population in the District of Nunoa (Puno) in the southern Peruvian Andes. Over the past two decades, Andean regions have experienced many socioeconomic changes, including the implementation of agrarian reform policies and increased integration into a market economy. Local changes in Nunoa have included improved transportation networks, new markets, an expanded public school system, and improved health care facilities. Secular trends in stature and weight have been found to be associated with social and economic development throughout the developing world, including Peru. The purpose of this paper is to present the findings from a re-study of growth in the Nunoan population, and to assess whether changing conditions in Nunoa have resulted in secular increases in growth.
   A cross-sectional sample of 1,466 children and adults and a mixed-longitudinal. sample of 404 children (age 3-22), measured between 1983 and 1984, are compared to similar samples collected from the same location between 1964 and 1966. Adolescents are taller, heavier, and somewhat fatter in the present population, although these differences diminish or disappear in adulthood. Age of maturation, peak growth velocities, and cessation of growth may come 1 to 2 years earlier than in the 1960s. As was found in earlier studies, growth velocities are low, the adolescent growth spurt is small, and sexual dimorphism is delayed. No secular trends in adult stature were found. Thus, the effects of social and economic change on nutrition, health, and growth in the population are uneven and generally unclear. This points to inequalities in access to the benefits of change throughout the region. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI A STRATEGY FOR CONSERVING THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE UTTARA-KANNADA
   DISTRICT IN SOUTH-INDIA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Taking the various values ascribed to biodiversity as its point of departure rather many years ago, the present study aims at deriving a conservation strategy for Uttara Kannada. This hilly district, with the highest proportion of its area under forests in South India, is divided into five ecological zones:  coastal, northern evergreen, southern evergreen, moist deciduous, and dry deciduous. The heavily-populated coastal zone includes mangrove forests and estuarine wetlands. The evergreen forests are particularly rich in the diversity of plant species which they support - including wild relatives of a number of cultivated plants. They also serve a vital function in watershed conservation. The moist deciduous forests are rich in bird species; both moist and dry deciduous forests include a number of freshwater ponds and lakes that support a high diversity of aquatic birds.
   Reviewing the overall distribution of biodiversity, we identify specific localities - including estuaries, evergreen forests, and moist deciduous forests - which should be set aside as Nature reserves. These larger reserves must be complemented by a network of traditionally-protected sacred groves and sacred trees that are distributed throughout the district and that protect today, for instance, the finest surviving stand of dipterocarp trees.
   We also spell out the necessary policy-changes in overall development strategy that should stem the ongoing decimation of biodiversity. These include (1) revitalizing community-based systems of sustainable management of village forests and protection of sacred groves and trees; (2) reorienting the usage-pattern of reserve forests from production of a limited variety of timber and softwood species for industrial consumers, to production of a larger diversity of non-wood forest produce of commercial value to support the rural economy; (3) utilizing marginal lands under private ownership for generating industrial wood supplies; and (4) provision of incentives for in situ maintenance of land-races of cultivated plants - especially evergreen, fruit-yielding trees - by the local people.
   It is proposed that this broad framework be now taken to the local communities, and that an action-plan be developed on the basis of inputs provided - and initiatives taken - by them.

AB Objective. This study describes demographic characteristics of pediatric AIDS patients, describes hospital and community-based service utilization patterns, and analyzes medical and social support service usage patterns with respect to patient demographic characteristics, clinical trial participation, functional/developmental status, and social environment.
   Data Sources and Study Setting. Data reported in this study are from the AIDS Casts and Service Utilization Survey (ACSUS) and cover the six-month period beginning March 1991 (N = 135). Pediatric patients who sought care for HIV-related problems were sampled at seven different hospitals in five metropolitan regions of the United States. All of the participating hospitals had clinics specifically serving pediatric patients infected with HIV. The sample consists of HIV-positive patients who had had at least one HIV-related symptom or condition.
   Study Design. A stratified probability sample design guided the sampling strategy, which included oversampling in two large hospitals from two of the five metropolitan areas. Survey data cover an 18-month time period of health care utilization, cost, and financing information from HIV-infected patients and their providers. Utilization measures are standardized to a six-month period. Per capita income, family structure, informal personal network, functional status, and clinical trial participation are tested for associations with patterns of utilization. In addition, a weighted ten-point social severity scale was developed to assess family/household stability.
   Data Collection. Data were collected through a screener instrument completed by the person accompanying the child to a hospital clinic visit (usually a parent), and through two interviews conducted in person with the patients' primary caregivers. Data from the questionnaires were coded and assembled into computerized SAS analysis files by WESTAT.
   Principal Findings. Children in this sample are 62 percent African American, 25 percent Hispanic, and 10 percent White. Medicaid is the primary payer for 92 percent. Mean per capita income is $3,440. Fewer than one-half (41 percent) of the families of the children receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Within the six-month period, approximately one-third of the sample (29.6 percent) was hospitalized. Mean length of stay was 16.0 days. Clinical trial participation was positively related to mean number of hospital clinic visits and receipt of formal (paid) home care. There were no differences in use of community clinic, mental health, and inpatient facilities by clinical trial status. Participation in clinical trials was positively related to income and negatively related to social severity. In four cities, emergency room use was consistently lower for clinical trial participants than for nonparticipants.
   Conclusions. Data from the first six months of the ACSUS pediatric sample suggest that participation in clinical trials may bring about access to social services that appear to reduce emergency room use. However, the findings reported here are descriptive and exploratory. Further multivariate, nonparametric analyses of the full 18-month provider-patient merged data set are necessary to confirm the simple correlations found in this study.

SO EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB The establishment of joint ventures is probably the most topical issue Of the transformation of any former centrally planned, socialist command economy into a market one. Foreign direct investments, technology imports, the involvement of supplementary funds into the national economy, market access for the more sophisticated export goods, the catching up with global networks-all the above key issues of the transformation and the further development of the Hungarian economy can be assisted by joint ventures.
   Hungary has relatively long standing experience in setting up joint ventures: since the early 1970s Hungary has consistently had by far the most JVs among the former CMEA countries. It has attracted over half the total foreign direct investments into Central and Eastern Europe and is a pioneer in setting up tripartite JVs, that is, guiding Western capital toward East European investments.
   The development of JVs and their fast growth in number are especially relevant for the period 1988-91. Most of them are relatively small. Services, including domestic and foreign trade, is the most frequented area of operation. Traditional trading partners, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, are the most active investors. Nevertheless, the United States and Japan, although involved in only a limited number of businesses, have injected the greatest amount of moneY so far. A considerable number of large multinationals, such as Ford, GM, GE, Siemens, Bull, Hyundai, Citicorp, Paribas, BNP, Dresdner Bank, Colonia, Allianz, etc., are present in Hungary-based joint ventures. As early as 1988 the major legal framework was established. The necessary financial services, e.g., commercial banking services, insurance, auditing and consulting, and an operating stock exchange, are obtainable, and Hungarian managers are more than willing to take part in the establishment of joint ventures. There are more than 10,000 operating JVs in the country. They are the obvious evidence of the vitality of joint ventures. In recent years Hungary has been able to attract as much as USD 900-1,400 million annually in terms of foreign direct investment, including JVs.
   Taking part in the establishment of new JVs is obviously a question of confidence. Therefore, if Hungary would like to accumulate more foreign investments-and at least USD 2.5 billion a year is needed for a faster privatization and restructuring of the economy-a stable political climate, a sustained macroeconomic policy, and consistent venture promotion are musts for further development.
   There is a great demand for foreign capital in Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, the countries of the region, especially Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, are in competition. Hungary has a fairly large advantage over its two major regional competitors: the country has relatively developed financial services, it has traditionally larger and deeper relations with transnational corporations, and small and medium-sized Hungarian companies are much more numerous and experienced than their regional competitors. There is a possibility of transforming Hungary into a certain kind of capital and financial center in and for Central and Eastern Europe. In this development the existing joint ventures will certainly play a key role.
